# Quickstart Characters

## Core

These characters are meant to exemplify how Skill20 characters can be just like archetypal D&D classes with some extra spice.

- [Cleric, Draconian](/QuickstartCharacters/DraconianCleric.txt)
- [Rogue, Felinoid](/QuickstartCharacters/FelinoidRogue.txt)
- [Wizard, Fairy](/QuickstartCharacters/FairyWizard.txt)

## Challenge

These characters are more specialized, and are very lacking in other areas.
