## Ranking

### Entry

First, you must pass a written test to show that you are mentally-competent. Then, your identity must be verified to ensure that you have no ties to anyone who opposes the guild. Finally, you must complete six months of basic training and show that you can handle intense situations under pressure. Upon the completion of basic training, you will be given your first rank.

### Increase

Gaining ranks in the Soldier Guild is a combination of merit and politics. Showing great discipline, leadership, initiative, and skills will help. Proving yourself in battle, or at the very least, showing that you can follow orders will also help. There are various activities, such as participating in honor parades and helping to clean weapons, that provide ranking score. You must also establish good relationships with your superiors.

### Decay

Do anything that results in a serious disciplinary action. Go absent without official leave. Piss off the wrong higher-ranked guild member. Get a reputation for refusing to follow orders. Give away secrets or compromise operational security.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Lead a team of between four to ten other guild members into battle. Make sure that your fellow guild members are following discipline and doing proper maintenance on their gear. Teach lower-ranked members about all the tricks of the trade.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Lead troops in honor parades. Lead whole squads of twenty to thirty guild members into battle. Transfer to more elite units. Sign up for officer candidate school.
