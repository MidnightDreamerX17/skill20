## Ranking

### Entry

Demonstrate proficiency in at least one perform skill, and pay a 10 gold registration fee. Participate in practice sessions for your chosen performing specialty. Get along with everyone else in the practice sessions. You will then be given a membership form to fill out and become a member.

### Increase

Work for the Performers Union using your performing skills. Gain seniority by working competently for long periods of time. Be reliable for large and complex productions. Train lesser-experienced members. Help teach classes for newcomers. Getting lucky with popular events helps improve rank more quickly, whereas being associated with failed events will slow down your progress.

### Decay

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Take on new members as your subordinates. Run the practice sessions for new members.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities
