## Ranking

### Entry

Show up to a Chaos Association meeting and make a good impression on everyone there. It's important that they all have a good feeling about you, and that you show you are chaotic rather than boring. In order to be allowed to attend the meeting, you probably would need a connection with a few members.

### Increase

Be well liked. Make everyone feel that you are a master of chaos. Get people to follow you without actually making any plans. Make people have fun in spontaneous events.

### Decay

Be unpopular. Come across to members as being too stiff or orderly. Rely too much on plans and structure. Don't go along with spontaneous events.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Host fun parties. Be a cool person. Say funny things. Invite a lot of people to show up to Chaos Association meetings.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Your home is now a de-facto Chaos Association meeting place, where other members will randomly come and go. You must give your opinion on all sorts of matters, and arbitrate conflicts that happen between lower-ranked members.
