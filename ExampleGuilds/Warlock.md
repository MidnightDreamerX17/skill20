## Ranking

### Entry

Make a blood pact with an otherworldly patron, mixed with the blood of a high-ranking member. Your presence in the guild becomes conditional upon the integrity of that blood pact.

### Decay

Get out of your obligations with your otherworldly patrons by any method other than completing them. Keep secret pacts to yourself. Allow extraplanars to go free without any kind of negotiation. Have too few blood pacts with otherworldly patrons.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Go around in public and encourage people to make pacts with your otherworldly patrons. Protect libraries and artifact rooms from outsiders. Maintain catalogues of extraplanars. Ensure that lower-ranked members stay loyal and do not renege on their agreements.
