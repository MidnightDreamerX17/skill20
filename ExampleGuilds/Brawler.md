### Entry

Sign up for a free brawling session, show that you are serious about brawling during the session, then pay membership fees afterwards. Typical membership fees range from 50 to 200 gold per month, depending on the highest-ranking guild member who is managing the guildhouse. 50 gold per month is usually for basic training and exercise, while 200 gold per month is a wide variety of possible training.

### Increase

Learn the many brawling techniques, take tests to show that you know them and that you are using proper form and technique. Fight brawlers from other gyms in the guild. Fight in amateur "smoker" fights against challengers. Help teach lower-ranked members how to brawl. Do not attack the head or knees of fellow members without using the proper protection.
