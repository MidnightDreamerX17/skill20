## Ranking

### Entry

You must pledge yourself to the gods of neutrality, and allow your mind to be thoroughly examined. Then you must undergo a number of ordeals in order to prove that you are neutral and that you desire balance in all things. These involve living amongst the Neutral Association, being tested with situations where a directionally-aligned person would surely act differently, and other such ordeals.

### Increase

Work to improve balance. Create harmony and unity. Get different people to agree on common ground. Act in accordance with the gods of neutrality.

### Decay

Fail to seek compromise between Good and Evil, or between Law and Chaos. Act against the gods of neutrality. Allow unsustainable practices to cause damage to nature.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Serve as a negotiator and mediator. Teach the path of neutrality to lower-ranked members. Conduct ceremonies and rituals for the gods of neutrality. Take care of various administrative details in the local guild branch.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Proactively try to halt the alignment wars, and bring the leaders of the other associations to the bargaining table. Start a new guild branch, and take responsibility for all of its functions. Teach the path of neutrality to non-members.
