## Ranking

### Entry

You must go through an obstacle course and complete it as quickly as possible without being seen. Your sneaking techniques will be examined in other ways as well. You must then undergo an ordeal of living in complete darkness for a week. Finally, you will be permitted to join.

### Increase

Infiltrate secure locations and leave your calling card. Place your calling card into the clothes of the rich and powerful. Participate in improvised dance routines in darkness. Help lower-ranked members on their path to be masters at shadowdancing. Get more comfortable with living in complete darkness.

### Decay

Do not challenge yourself with increasingly-difficult sneaking missions. Fail to create rumors about yourself, consequently becoming unknown and without fame. Hinder the progress of lower-ranked members. Do not show up to dances, or dance too many times in light. Live too long in the light.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Choreograph dance routines. Scout out opportunities for other members to infiltrate. Help to design calling cards for lower-ranked members.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Design obstacle courses. Be the lead dancer in complex dance routines. Start up new guild schools, and hire all the necessary people to run them. You must have a mysterious mask, crafted in pitch black conditions, to achieve Rank 20.
