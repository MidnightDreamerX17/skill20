# Example Guilds

Guilds are the closest thing there are to "classes" in Skill20, in the sense of being skill sets with names that are considered to fulfill certain archetypes. But, membership in a guild is never required unless the GM uses a specific form of the optional rule *Training Required For Skill Advancement*. They also come with obligations and responsibilities. Each guild is ruled by a number of grandmasters, who teach their special skills to those who they deem worthy.

Characters may choose to join guilds and advance in Rank. Each guild has a detailed description of the requirements to join, the requirements to gain rank, and the responsibilities of each rank.

Most guilds have a rank structure like this:
- Rank 1 (Novice) - Expected to try out the guild as a hobby, then wash out.
- Rank 5 (Apprentice) - Considered to be dedicated enough to trust with basic duties and training.
- Rank 10 (Journeyman) - Responsible for teaching others and managing new members. Most guilds allow Rank 10 members to teach the most important skills of the guild to other members.
- Rank 15 (Expert) - Responsible for taking part in large-scale guild activities, furthering the interests of the guild, and fighting against opposing guilds.
- Rank 20 (Alderman) - Trusted to set up new branches of the guild, although with supervision from masters and grandmasters.
- Rank 30 (Master) - Take part in decisions that affect the whole guild.
- Rank 40 (Grandmaster) - Allowed to teach advanced skills to other members.

Most guilds require that members attain the rank of Master before they can receive advanced training from Grandmasters. Therefore, members are encouraged fulfill their obligations and rise up in the ranks of their guilds, so that they can eventually learn Advanced skills.

Quick Overview of the Example Guilds:

- **[Acrobat](/ExampleGuilds/Acrobat.md)** - Using fanciful body movement to accomplish everything. Strongly linked to the Performers Union.
- **[Alchemist](/ExampleGuilds/Alchemist.md)** - Adherents of the scientific method, especially testable hypotheses and wanting hard facts and data. Yet, most alchemists also infuse random bits of religion into their minds, which has real effects on their alchemy. For example, only those who have performed various religious rites of purification have been able to create certain alchemical substances. Other alchemists swear by the path of non-adherence to religious rites.
- **[Assassin](/ExampleGuilds/Assassin.md)** - Killing people for money, in the most precise and subtle way possible. Strongly linked to the Ninja Guild.
- **[Avenger](/ExampleGuilds/Avenger.md)** - Using one's force of personality and inherent potential to express base desires. Rejecting any social norms that are considered "old-fashioned."
- **[Barbarian](/ExampleGuilds/Barbarian.md)** - Not against technology or shamanic magic, but very much against any form of societal organization other than tribalism. The Barbarian Guild is held together by the strength and tribal ties of the guildmasters.
- **[Bard](/ExampleGuilds/Bard.md)** - Taking a little bit of everything and infusing it into magical music.
- **[Bishop](/ExampleGuilds/Bishop.md)** - Knowing everything possible, including all forms of magic, psionics, alchemy, item lore, and other non-physical disciplines. Strongly linked to the Knowledge Union, but enemy of many of the other magical guilds.
