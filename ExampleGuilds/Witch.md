# Witch Guild

**Liked Guilds:** Sorcerer, Warlock

**Disliked Guilds:** Alchemist, Inquisitor

## Ranking

### Entry

Show that your matrilineal lineage is connected to the guild, or marry a guild member. Show that you know the basic rituals of witchcraft, and that you have helped to preserve the oral traditions.

### Increase

Advancement in the Witch Guild is based on seniority. The longer you spend in the guild, the more ranks that will accrue to you. There are also many political elements, such as developing connections with higher-ranked members who are themselves on track to promotion, and being the patron of lower-ranked members who have proved themselves. Having well-behaved children, and giving a lot of advice on how to raise obedient children, is also worth quite a bit for seniority score. Last but not least, accepting the guild's consensus on who you should be mating with is worth political score.

### Decay

Get on the wrong side of politics somehow. This includes and is not limited to: your children being disruptive and rude, having weak blood connections to the guild, being too ambitious for someone of your seniority, committing a cultural faux-pas, serving higher-ranked members who have been disgraced, being the patron of lower-ranked members who have done shameful acts, and trying to mate with someone who has already been claimed by another member.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Teach the basics of witchcraft and guild rituals to the lower-ranked members. Start getting connecting to higher-ranked members, tying your political fortunes to them. Start taking in lower-ranked members as apprentices, staking your future reputation on them. Take part in more secret rituals.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Conduct guild rituals for the local branch. Arrange mating partnerships for lower-ranked members. Deliver reports on how your local guild branch exemplifies excellent witchcraft. Get assignments to grow or startup new guild branches.
