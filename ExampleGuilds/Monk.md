## Ranking

### Entry

Pledge your life to an eternity of mastering the monk arts, both martial and spiritual. Serve in many mundane roles such as cook, dust sweeper, and target practice. Once you have proven yourself as a worthy lay-member, you will be inducted to the guild in a ceremony. The ceremony includes cutting all your hair and changing your clothes to the guild uniform.

### Increase

Complete a variety of tests, complete exercises that train both mind and body, master your inner chi, do exercises with higher-ranked members that examine the flow of your chi. Go on journeys to exotic places to help you better know yourself. Last but not least, fight against members of other guild branches to prove your mastery of the monk arts.

### Decay

Completely destroy any arts or styles, rather than leaving enough survivors to continue the traditions. Cease to teach the most important monk arts from your guild branch. Allow your own style to stagnate due to lack of testing. Fail tests that are meant to improve your moral character.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

Teach the basics of fighting and chi exercise to lower-ranked members. Help to administer tests for new members. Search for potential recruits. Defend your local guild chapter against challenges.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Seek out prize-fighting opportunities and other contracts which will keep the guild cash-positive. Establish a new guild branch and teach the arts. Administer tests to lower-ranked members. Go on pilgrimage to learn from other masters and grandmasters.
