## Ranking

### Entry

You must live for some time in a Druid grove and show that you are neutral-hearted, able to get along with the others in the guild. You must also demonstrate that you have empathy for nature and wildlife. Then, the higher-ranking members will choose to induct you into the guild.

### Increase

Over time, you must gain new realizations and understandings about nature. You must have your heart examined by the gods of nature. You must live in the wilds and preserve them from outsiders. Find new types of nature and commune with them.

### Decay

Allow outsiders to ruin nature, or otherwise establish an economy based on non-renewable resources. Let your heart drift too far from nature and animals. Act against the gods of nature.

### Rank 10 Responsibilities

You are responsible for the defense of a sacred grove, and for the peace and well-being of all who dwell within it. Teach the basics of druid magic to lower-ranked members.

### Rank 20 Responsibilities

Participate in efforts to establish new sacred groves, and to reclaim territory to be turned back into wildlands. Teach lower-ranked members how to commune with nature.
