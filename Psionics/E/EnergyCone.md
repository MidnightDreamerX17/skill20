Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You create a cone of energy of the chosen type, extending outward from your hand, that deals 5d6 points of damage to every creature or object within the area.

**Cold:** A cone of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold cone is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.

**Electricity:** Manifesting a cone of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save difficulty and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

**Fire:** A cone of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. 

**Sonic:** A cone of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and shatters all fragile objects within the area. It does double damage to anything that is weak to *Shatter* and similar effects.

This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest. 

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
