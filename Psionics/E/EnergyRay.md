**Cold:** A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

**Electricity:** Manifesting a ray of this energy type provides a +3 bonus on your attack accuracy if the target is wearing metal armor and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

**Fire:** A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

**Sonic:** A ray of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and shatters all fragile objects on the target. It does double damage to anything that is weak to *Shatter* and similar effects.

This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest. 

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by one die (d6).
