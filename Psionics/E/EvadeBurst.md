You throw off a faux ectoplasmic shell, allowing you to slide out of range of a damaging effect. When you manifest this power in conjunction with making a successful Dexterity save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come within range of a dangerous effect. Manifesting this power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power. You can even manifest this power when it isnâ€™t your turn.

**Augment:** If you spend 4 additional power points, you take only half damage on a failed Dexterity save.
