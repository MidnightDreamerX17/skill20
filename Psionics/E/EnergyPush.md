Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You project a solid blast of energy of the chosen type at a target, dealing it 2d6 points of damage. In addition, if the target fails a Strength check (difficulty equal to 10 + manifester level), the driving force of the energy blast pushes it back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of damage it takes. If a wall or other solid object prevents the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead slams into the object and takes an extra 2d6 points of damage from the impact (no save).

**Cold:** A push of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold push is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.

**Electricity:** Manifesting a push of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save difficulty and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

**Fire:** A push of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

**Sonic:** A push of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and shatters all fragile objects on the targets. It does double damage to anything that is weak to *Shatter* and similar effects.

This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest. 

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1. The damage increase applies to both the initial blast and any damage from impact with an object.
