You radiate a psychokinetic burst that disrupts and negates all types of invisibility (though this power can’t negate the effect of *Cloud Mind*). Any creature that fails its save to avoid the effect loses its invisibility.

Creatures that are naturally invisible, such as an invisible stalker, are revealed as a dim outline for 1 round (until the beginning of your next turn) and do not have total concealment during this period.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s map range and the map radius of the burst in which it functions both increase by 5 feet.
