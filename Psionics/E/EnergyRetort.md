Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You weave a field of potential energy of the chosen type around your body. The first successful attack made against you in each round during the power’s duration prompts a response from the field with out any effort on your part. The attack may be physical, the effect of a power, or the effect of a spell (including spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities). An “ectoburst” discharges from the field, targeting the source of the attack and dealing 4d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. To be affected, a target must be within close range, you must have line of sight and line of effect to it, and you must be able to identify the source of the attack.

**Cold:** A retort of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold retort is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.

**Electricity:** Manifesting a retort of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save difficulty and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

**Fire:** A retort of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

**Sonic:** A retort of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and shatters all fragile objects on the targets. It does double damage to anything that is weak to *Shatter* and similar effects.

This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest. 

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 minute.
