You (plus all your gear and any objects you carry) become difficult to detect by clairsentience powers such as *Clairvoyant Sense*, *Remote Viewing*, and *True Seeing Psionic*. If a clairsentience power or similar effect is attempted against you, the manifester of the power must succeed on a manifester level check (1d20 + manifester level, or caster level if the opponent is not a manifester) against a difficulty of 13 + your manifester level.

**Augment:** Each power point spent on the augment increases the difficulty by 1.
