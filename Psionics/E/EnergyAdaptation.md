Your body assimilates some of the effect of an energy attack and converts it to harmless light. You gain a bonus of +10 to resist against any attack that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. The power protects your equipment as well.

When you absorb damage, you can choose to radiate visible light that illuminates a 60-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage you successfully resisted, or merely dissipate the energy without giving off a visual display.

The energy resistance provided by this power increases with manifester level as follows:

| Manifester Level | Resistance Bonus | Damage Modifier |
| ---              | ---              | ---             |
| 7                | +10              | 1 point less per die
| 9                | +20              | 2 points less per die
| 13               | +30              | half damage
| 17               | +40              | one-fourth damage

The resistance provided by this power does not stack with other forms of energy resistance.

This powerâ€™s subtype is the same as the type of damage it protects against.

**Augment:** If you spend 4 additional power points, you can manifest this power as an immediate action. This would also allow the power to be manifested outside of your turn, even if you do not have a prepared reaction.
