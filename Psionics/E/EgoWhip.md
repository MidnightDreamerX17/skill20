Your rapid mental lashings assault the ego of your enemy, debilitating its confidence. The target takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage, or half that amount (minimum 1 point) on a successful save. A target that fails its save is also *dazed* for 1 round. The *dazed* condition causes the creature to be unable to use its hands to do anything other than gripping for the duration.

**Augment:** For every 4 additional power points you spend, this powerâ€™s Charisma damage increases by 1d4 points and its save difficulty increases by 2.
