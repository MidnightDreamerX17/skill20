Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You release a powerful stroke of the chosen energy type that encircles all creatures in the area, dealing 1d6 points of damage to each of them. In addition, any creature that fails its save for half damage must succeed on a Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 round. The stun condition renders the target unable to act, and causes them to have a -2 penalty to Armor Class.

**Cold:** A stroke of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold stroke is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.

**Electricity:** Manifesting a stroke of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save difficulty and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

**Fire:** A stroke of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. 

**Sonic:** A stroke of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and shatters all fragile objects within the area. It does double damage to anything that is weak to *Shatter* and similar effects.

This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest. 

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
