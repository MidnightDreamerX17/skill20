This power reinforces an astral construct created by the *Astral Construct* power, giving you a +1 bonus on any manifester level checks you make to protect it against *Dispel Psionics* or a similar effect, and a +1 bonus on its saving throw to resist *Dismiss Ectoplasm*. This power can be manifested as a swift action in the same round that you manifest an astral construct, as long as the power points you spend to perform both actions does not exceed your manifester level.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, your bonus on manifester level checks to protect your astral construct increases by 1, and your astral constructâ€™s bonus on its saving throw to resist *Dismiss Ectoplasm* increases by 1.
