You gain low-light vision (as an elf) for the duration of the power, as well as a +2 bonus on visual searching and spotting checks.

In addition, you gain the ability to notice secret or concealed doors by merely passing within 5 feet of one, getting to make a visual searching check as if you were actively looking for it.

If *Elfsight* is used in conjunction with *My Light*, the light extends out to 40 feet instead of 20 feet.
