Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You create an explosion of unstable ectoplasmic energy of the chosen type that deals 5d6 points of damage to every creature or object within the area. The explosion creates almost no pressure. Since this power extends outward from you, you are not affected by the damage.

**Cold:** A ball of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold ball is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.

**Electricity:** Manifesting a ball of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save difficulty and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

**Fire:** A ball of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. 

**Sonic:** A ball of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and shatters all fragile objects within the area. It does double damage to anything that is weak to *Shatter* and similar effects.

This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest. 

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
