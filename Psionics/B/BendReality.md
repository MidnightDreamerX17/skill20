*Bend Reality* lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, bend reality can do any of the following:

-  Duplicate any psionic power of 6th circle or lower.
-  Undo the harmful effects of many powers, such as *Psionic Dominate*, *Geas/Quest*, or *Insanity*.
-  Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a â€“8 penalty on its next saving throw. 

A duplicated power allows saving throws and power resistance as normal.
