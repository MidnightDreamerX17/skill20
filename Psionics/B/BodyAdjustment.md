You take control of your bodyâ€™s healing process, curing yourself of 1d12 points of damage. This also decreases the duration of poisons and diseases inside of you by a number of combat rounds (10-second increments) equal to the amount of damage cured. As usual, when regular damage is healed, an equal amount of nonlethal damage is also healed.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power heals an additional 1d12 points of damage. The duration decrease of poisons and diseases inside of you is reduced according to the additional healing as well.
