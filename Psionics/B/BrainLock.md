The subjectâ€™s higher mind is locked away. He stands dazed, unable to take any psionic actions (including manifesting powers) nor any mental actions at all.

A brain locked subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage against him.

A brain locked flyer must descend to the closest safe level area below it. An air-breathing swimmer must make for the surface.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also affect an animal, fey, giant, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.
2. If you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature types mentioned above.
