You have metaphoric “eyes in the back of your head,” and on the sides and top as well, granting you benefits in specific situations. In effect, you have a 360-degree sphere of sight, allowing you a perfect view of creatures that might otherwise flank you. Thus, flanking opponents gain no bonus on their attack rolls, and it is impossible to use Stealth (DEX) special attacks against you in combat (but they may still function against you if you are caught surprised). Your visual spotting and searching checks gain a +4 bonus.

Concurrently, you take a –4 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks during the power’s duration, such as that of the Medusa.
