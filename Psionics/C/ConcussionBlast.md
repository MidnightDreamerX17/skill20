A subject you select is pummeled with telekinetic force for 1d6 points of force damage. You can choose to have the power deal an equal amount of nonlethal damage instead. *Concussion Blast* always affects a subject within range that you can see, even if the subject is in melee or has cover or concealment (you cannot use this power against creatures with total cover or total concealment).

Nonmagical, unattended objects (including doors, walls, locks, and so on) may also be damaged by this power.

Augment: You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this powerâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 points.
2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. In map combat, any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power. In map-less combat, the targets must be in the same row.
