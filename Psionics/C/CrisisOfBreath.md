You compel the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the subject’s autonomic breathing cycle. The subject’s lungs do not automatically function again while the power’s duration lasts.

If the target succeeds on a Wisdom save when *Crisis of Breath* is manifested, it is unaffected by this power. If it fails its Wisdom save, it can still continue to breathe by using its action in each round to gasp for breath.

An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but each round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its Wisdom save, the subject risks blacking out from lack of oxygen. It must succeed on a Constitution save at the end of any of its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. The Difficulty of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the first one that goes by without a breath; the Difficulty drops back to its original value if the subject spends an action to take a breath.

If a subject fails a Constitution save, it is disabled (0 hp). In the following round, it drops to –1 hit points and is dying. Curing powers or spells can revive a dying subject normally, so long as this power’s duration has expired; if the power is still in effect, a revived creature is still subject to Constitution saves in each round when it does not consciously breathe.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.

1. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also affect an animal, fey, giant, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.
2. If you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature types mentioned above.
3. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power can affect up to four creatures all within a 20-foot-radius burst. In map-less combat, this augment targets a whole row of enemies.

In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of these effects, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
