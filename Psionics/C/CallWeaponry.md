You call a weapon “from thin air” into your waiting hand (actually, it is a real weapon hailing from another location in space and time). You don’t have to see or know of a weapon to call it — in fact, you can’t call a specific weapon, brand, crafter, stockpile, etc. You just specify the kind that would be favorable for your skills, traits, and feats. If you call a projectile weapon, it comes with 3d6 nonmagical bolts, arrows, or sling bullets, as appropriate. The weapon is made of ordinary materials as appropriate for its kind. If you relinquish your grip on the weapon you called for 2 or more consecutive rounds, it automatically returns to wherever it originated.

Weapons gained by *Call Weaponry* are distinctive due to their astral glimmer. They are considered to have magic reinforcement +1.

**Augment:** For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power improves the weapon’s magic reinforcement by 1.
