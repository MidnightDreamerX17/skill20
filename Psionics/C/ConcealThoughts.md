You protect the subjectâ€™s thoughts from analysis. While the duration lasts, the subject gains a +10 bonus against those attempting to discern its true intentions. It also gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw against any power or spell used to read its mind (such as *Read Thoughts* or *Mind Probe*).

**Augment:** For every additional power point spent, the bonus to conceal motives is increased by +2, and the bonus against mind-reading effects is increased by +1.
