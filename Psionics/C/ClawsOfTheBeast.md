You call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself, psionically transforming your hands into deadly claws. You gain a natural weapon dealing 1d8 damage.

Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power on your turn before you attack. Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.

You can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during the duration of the power. If you attack with a manufactured weapon or another natural attack, you can’t make any claw attacks in that round. You can still hold and manipulate items with your claws or cast spells just as well as you could with your hands.

**Augment:** If you spend additional power points, you can create larger, sharper, and more deadly claws, as shown on the table below.

| 1            | 1d8         |
