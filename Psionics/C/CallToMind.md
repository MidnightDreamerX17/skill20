By meditating on a subject, you can recall natural memories and knowledge otherwise inaccessible to you.

On a failed Knowledge (INT) check, for which you had at least one level of the relevant Knowledge specialty, you can manifest this power to gain a new check with a +4 bonus. If successful, you instantly recall what was previously buried in your subconscious. On a failure, you can manifest the power additional times, paying the power point cost and manifesting time as normal.

**Augment:** Each additional power point spent on this power increases the bonus by +1. Five power points can be spent to apply this power to a Knowledge specialty that you do not have.
