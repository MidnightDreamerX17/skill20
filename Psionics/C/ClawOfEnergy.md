If you have a natural weapon (including temporary ones created by psionic powers and magic spells), you can use this power to energize that weapon. The attack deals an extra 1d6 points of cold, electricity, or fire damage (as chosen by you at the time of manifestation) on a successful hit. On a natural 20 for accuracy, it deals an extra 1d10 points of energy damage, for a total of +1d6+1d10.

This power can be manifested on a natural weapon that already deals energy damage, but if the weapon already deals the same type of damage as the power, the effects stack. If this power is manifested on a natural weapon already benefiting from the effect of the power, the newer manifestation supersedes the older manifestation, even if both manifestations are of different energy types.

This powerâ€™s subtype is the same as the type of energy infused in the natural weapon.
