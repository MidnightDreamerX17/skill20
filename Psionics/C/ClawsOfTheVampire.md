If you have a natural weapon (including temporary ones made by psionic powers and magic spells), you can use this power to change the nature of that weapon. When this power is manifested, your natural weapon takes on an ominous glimmer. Each time you make a successful attack against a living creature, you are healed of some amount of damage.

You heal a number of hit points equal to half the base damage dealt by your *Claws of the Vampire*, rounded down. You heal as many hit points as can be gained while the creature remains at 1 hit point or higher. Any damage that would reduce the creature to 0 or fewer hit points does not benefit you.

You do not heal damage if your attack deals nonlethal damage. Moreover, you gain no healing from attacking any creature that is under the effect of *Biofeedback*. Using *Fission* on yourself and then attacking your duplicate also fails to grant any healing.
