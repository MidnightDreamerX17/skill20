This power causes instant diminution, halving your height, length, and width and dividing your weight by 8. You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a –2 penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1). This power doesn’t change your map movement speed.

All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly reduced by the power. Multiple effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second manifestation of this power to further reduce yourself.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.

1. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power decreases your size further. You gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and a –4 penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1).
2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action.
3. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power’s duration is 1 minute per manifester level rather than 1 round per manifester level.
