If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as *Claws of the Beast*), you can use this power to improve that weapon. One of your claws becomes two-dimensional, making it razorsharp. The weapon is now psionically keen, increasing its automatic-hit range from 20 to 17â€“20.

The third spatial component of your hand still exists but is temporarily shunted into the Ethereal Plane, so against ethereal or incorporeal targets this power is ineffective.
