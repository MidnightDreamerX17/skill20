You create a psychokinetic shield around the subject that improves the chance that any powers affecting the subject will resist a *Dispel Psionics* power (or a *Dispel Magic* spell) or a negation effect that targets a specific power (such as *Shatter Mind Blank*). When *Dispelling Buffer* is manifested on a creature or object, add +5 to the difficulty of the dispel check for each ongoing effect that is subject to being dispelled.

*Dispel Psionics* can negate *Dispelling Buffer*, but against a targeted dispel, *Dispelling Buffer* is always checked last (with the same +5 difficulty modifier). Against an area dispel, *Dispelling Buffer* is checked in the order according to its level (with the same +5 difficulty modifier).
