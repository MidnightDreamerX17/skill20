You fill your enemies with self-doubt. Any enemy in the area that fails its save becomes shaken for the duration of the power. Allies and creatures without an Intelligence score are unaffected. The shaken condition causes a penalty of -2 to all d20 rolls.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s map range and the map radius of its area both increase by 5 feet, and the power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
