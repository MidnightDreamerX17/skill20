You warp space around an individual, hindering the subject’s ability to move. The subject’s map speed (in any movement mode it possesses) is halved. A subsequent manifestation of *Deceleration* on the subject does not further decrease its speed.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect a target one size category larger.
