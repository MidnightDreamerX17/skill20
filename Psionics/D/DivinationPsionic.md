As the *Divination* spell, except as noted here. 

Even though this is a psionic power rather than a clerical magic spell, it still requires communicating with a deity or equivalent power. Since you are not using a divine connection to perform the communication, you will instead need to reach out to a deity of your alignment, whose home plane is known.
