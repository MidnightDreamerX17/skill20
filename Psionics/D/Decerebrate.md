With *Decerebrate*, you selectively remove a portion of the subjectâ€™s brain stem. The creature loses all cerebral function, vision, hearing, and other sensory abilities, and all voluntary motor activity. The subject becomes limp and unresponsive. Without extreme measures, such as *Greater Restoration* or some other suitable effect of 7th circle or higher, the creature perishes in 1d4 days.
