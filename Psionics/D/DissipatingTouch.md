Your hands become charged with the *Dissipating Touch* effect. The charge can be held for a maximum number of rounds equal to your manifester level.

When you do a successful melee attack within the duration, the *Dissipating Touch* is discharged. The effect disperses some of the surface material of the target, sending a tiny portion of it away. This effect is disruptive; thus, your successful melee attack does 1d6 additional points of damage.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this powerâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 points.
