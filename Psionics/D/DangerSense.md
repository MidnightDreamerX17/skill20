You can sense the presence of danger before your senses would normally allow it. Your intuitive sense alerts you to danger from traps, giving you a +4 bonus on Wisdom saves to avoid traps and a +4 bonus to Armor Class against attacks by traps.

**Augment:** If you spend 3 additional power points, this power also gives you the *uncanny dodge* ability for the duration. The *uncanny dodge* ability allows a Wisdom save against one attack per round to halve its damage. If you spend 6 power points on the augment instead, then this power gives you both the *uncanny dodge* and *improved uncanny dodge* abilities during the duration. The *improved uncanny dodge* ability causes you to never be considered flanked or back-attacked.
