You plant a hidden death-urge impulse in the subject’s unconscious. On the subject’s next turn, it looks for the quickest method to end its life and attempts to do so. The subject takes no other action on its turn except attempting to harm itself.

If armed, the subject focuses on attacking itself. The attack automatically succeeds and deals double damage. If unarmed, the subject tries to place itself into the path of the nearest enemy's attacks.

If the subject is unarmed and no enemy is nearby, the subject simply does nothing at all. A subject close to an immediate and lethal hazard such as a cliff or a fire might hurl itself off the cliff or into the fire instead of striking itself with a weapon.

**Augment:** For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power’s save difficulty increases by 2 and its duration increases by 1 round.
