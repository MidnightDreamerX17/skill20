You suffuse yourself with power, gaining 5 temporary hit points. Using this power again when an earlier manifestation has not expired merely replaces the older temporary hit points (if any remain) with the newer ones.

When the duration ends, the hit points are removed again.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, the number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 5.
