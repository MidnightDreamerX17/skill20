While reading books, studying artwork, listening to firsthand accounts, watching operas, etc. about an event, you can manifest *Visualize* to perceive a half-second glimpse of it. The perception of the event is according to those who experienced it, then passed on their knowledge of it to the records you have available. This means that you will encounter the cognitive bias of the people in that moment.

**Augment:** If you spend 2 power points on the augment, then the duration is changed to half of a round (5 seconds). Each power point spend on the augment beyond 2 points will increase the duration by half a round (5 seconds).

During the duration - if the people in the event were targeted by mind-altering affects, then you will also get targeted by half of the strength of the effects. You will have a bonus of +5 to save against the effects.
