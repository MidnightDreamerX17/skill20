This power cures all ability damage, and it restores all points drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one score is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target. *Restoration* does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

*Restoration* can remove negative levels. It can also restore one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained, if the number of days since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than your manifester level.
