When you manifest *Reddopsi*, powers targeted against you rebound to affect the original manifester. This effect reverses powers that have only you as a target (except *Dispel Psionics* and similar powers or effects). Powers that affect an area and those that produce effects can’t be reversed. *Reddopsi* also can’t reverse any power with a range of touch or melee.

Should you rebound a power back against a manifester who also is protected by *Reddopsi*, the power rebounds once more upon you.
