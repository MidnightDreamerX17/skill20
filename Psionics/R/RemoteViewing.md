You send your mind across space and dimensions, forming it into a quasireal viewpoint from which you can see and hear some creature located at any distance from you, even if planar boundaries separate you. If the subject succeeds on a Wisdom save, the *Remote Viewing* attempt fails, and you can’t attempt to view that creature again for at least 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Wisdom save.

| Knowledge | Wisdom Save Modifier |
| ---       | ---                  |
| None*     | +10
| Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) | +5
| Firsthand (you have met the subject) | +0
| Familiar (you know the subject well) | –5

With a knowledge level of "None", you must have one of the "Connection" modifiers to worsen the target's Wisdom save.

| Connection | Wisdom Save Modifier |
| ---        | ---                  |
| Likeness or picture | –2
| Possession or garment | –4
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. | –10
| Subject on another plane | +5

If the subject fails its Wisdom save, your mind coalesces a quasi-real viewpoint near enough to the subject to see and hear the subject and its immediate surroundings (up 30 feet in all directions away from the subject).

While the *Remote Viewing* lasts, your real body remains unmoving and unaware of your actual surroundings. On the other hand, your quasi-real viewpoint is treated in some ways as if it were an invisible ectoplasmic form of yourself, except as follows. As a quasi-real viewpoint, you can speak (though your voice is whispery).

You may potentially be sensed by the subject of your viewing (subjects who can see or sense invisible or hidden creatures automatically sense you; otherwise you make a Stealth (DEX) check with a +40 bonus to escape detection if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving). You could be attacked (although if you become subject to *Dispel Psionics*, the remote viewing simply ends). If the subject moves, you can attempt to follow it at a speed of 20 feet, though if it gets farther than 30 feet from you (or you move farther than 30 feet from it), the power ends.

You can attempt to manifest one power through your quasi-real viewpoint, but you must make a Concentration check (with the difficulty equal to 10 + the target's experience level) to succeed. Manifesting (or attempting and failing to manifest) a power immediately ends the *Remote Viewing*.
Furthermore, all powers from your quasi-real viewpoint cost twice the usual number of power points (you can’t exceed the power point limit set by your manifester level, so you are restricted to manifesting lower-circle powers than you otherwise could). Power points you spend as a quasireal viewpoint are drained from your real body.
