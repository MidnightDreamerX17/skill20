## The Origin of Psionics

Psionics are an expression of elemental power and of life energy. In this way, they are related to magic. However, psionics are tightly bound to one's own experiences and memories, so that every psionic user manifests their powers in a unique form. It is impossible for a psionic user to understand how to replicate the effects of someone else's form. The user's own creative energy, willpower for making good decisions, and logical judgment are involved in manifestation.

## Psionic Power Points

After eight hours of rest, all Psionic Power Points are regained. Interruptions of rest, such as being woken up or engaging in combat, prevent the recovery of Psionic Power Points.

## Manifesting Powers

The manifester chooses one of their known powers. Manifestation is mutually exclusive with all other actions. The manifestation takes a full round, and takes effect immediately before the manifester's next turn. Once the manifestation is finished, the manifester uses up all the Psionic Power Points required for the power. For example, manifesting *Adapt Body* uses up 9 Psionic Power Points.

The maximum amount of Psionic Power Points that can be spent on one power - combining base cost and any *augment* options - is equal to the manifester level. For example, at a manifester level of 10 using a power with a base cost of 5, no more than 5 power points can be spent to *augment* the power.

Any amount of damage during the manifestation will force a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the manifester. On a success, the power is not interrupted. On a failure, the power is interrupted, but the psionic power points are not expended.

## Converting Powers from d20 to Skill20

See the [Magic](/Magic) section for Converting Spells. In addition, the following conversions are suggested:

Disciplines are the same as from d20:

- Clairsentience
- Metacreativity
- Psychokinesis
- Psychometabolism
- Psychoportation
- Telepathy

Categories are derived from d20 psionic classes:

- Egoist power level X: Egoism category of the X+1 circle
- Kineticist power level X: Kineticism category of the X+1 circle
- Nomad power level X: Nomad category of the X+1 circle
- Psion/Wilder power level X: Power category of the X circle
- Psychic Warrior power level X: Warrior category X+1 circle
- Seer power level X: Seer category of the X+1 circle
- Shaper power level X: Shaper category of the X+1 circle
- Telepath power level X: Telepathy category of the X+1 circle

In short, all powers of the Psion & Wilder classes have the same power circle as before. All other powers have their power circle increased by 1.
