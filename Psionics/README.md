## The Origin of Psionics

Psionics are an expression of elemental power and of life energy. In this way, they are related to magic. However, psionics are tightly bound to one's own experiences and memories, so that every psionic user manifests their powers in a unique form. It is impossible for a psionic user to understand how to replicate the effects of someone else's form, except by special means. The user's own creative energy, willpower for making good decisions, and logical judgment are involved in manifestation.

## Psionic Power Points

After eight hours of rest, all Psionic Power Points are regained. Interruptions of rest, such as being woken up or engaging in combat, prevent the recovery of Psionic Power Points.

## Manifesting Powers

The manifester chooses one of their known powers. Manifestation is mutually exclusive with all other actions. The manifestation takes a full round, and takes effect immediately before the manifester's next turn. Once the manifestation is finished, the manifester uses up all the Psionic Power Points required for the power. For example, manifesting *Adapt Body* uses up 9 Psionic Power Points.

The maximum amount of Psionic Power Points that can be spent on one power - combining base cost and any *augment* options - is equal to the manifester level. For example, at a manifester level of 10 using a power with a base cost of 5, no more than 5 power points can be spent to *augment* the power.

Any amount of damage during the manifestation will force a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the manifester. On a success, the power is not interrupted. On a failure, the power is interrupted, but the psionic power points are not expended.

## Cognizance Crystals

Cognizance Crystals store Psionic Power Points. While holding one crystal, its power can be used to help manifest powers. There is no way to take energy from the crystal other than to manifest. Only one crystal can be used at a time.

2 of your own Psionic Power Points can be spent to add 1 point to a crystal.

The market value of a cognizance crystal depends on its maximum power points as follows:

| Maximum Points | Market Price |
| ---            | ---          |
| 1 | 1,000
| 3 | 4,000
| 5 | 9,000
| 7 | 16,000
| 9 | 25,000
| 11 | 36,000
| 13 | 49,000
| 15 | 64,000
| 17 | 81,000
| 19 | 100,000

## Manifestation Items

The common market value per use of an item is as follows:

| Power Circle | Price per use | Crafting Cost | Crafting threshold |

Manifestation items include and are not limited to:

- **Dorjes** - Crystals with multiple uses.
- **Power Stones** - Stones with a single use each.
- **Psicrowns** - Items worn on the head, with multiple uses.
- **Psionic Tattoos** - Psionic inks inscribed into your skin. Each tattoo is a single use.

In order to use a manifestation item, you must have an Intelligence equal to 10 + Power Circle.

If the item contains multiple uses, and you inherently know the same power that is in the item, then you can spend double the psionic power point cost to add one use to the item.

## Crafting Manifestation Items

The character must inherently know the power during the entire crafting process.

First, the character must provide a certain amount of gold value in materials. This depends on the power circle and the number of power uses.

Second, the character must make one skill check per day, accumulating a total throughout multiple days, until the threshold difficulty is exceeded.

Psionic Tattoos require only one hour of inscription per day. Psionic Tattoos do not finish faster than other manifestation items, but up to ten can be worked-on per day.

The skill used for crafting is Craft (INT) (Psionic Focuses)

## Converting Powers from d20 to Skill20

Disciplines are the same as from d20:

- Clairsentience
- Metacreativity
- Psychokinesis
- Psychometabolism
- Psychoportation
- Telepathy

Categories are derived from d20 psionic classes:

- Egoist power level X: Egoism category of the X+1 circle
- Kineticist power level X: Kineticism category of the X+1 circle
- Nomad power level X: Nomad category of the X+1 circle
- Psion/Wilder power level X: Power category of the X circle
- Psychic Warrior power level X: Warrior category X+1 circle
- Seer power level X: Seer category of the X+1 circle
- Shaper power level X: Shaper category of the X+1 circle
- Telepath power level X: Telepathy category of the X+1 circle

If a power has both a Psion/Wilder level and another level, then the Psion/Wilder level is used.

In short, all powers of the Psion & Wilder classes have the same power circle as before. All other powers have their power circle increased by 1.
