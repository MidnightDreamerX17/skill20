This power transforms your body into living oak, which grants you several advantages.

You gain a +5 bonus to armor. You are immune to ability damage, blindness, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all powers, spells, or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect.

You take only half damage from cold effects of all kinds. However, you become susceptible to all special attacks that affect wood, and you gain vulnerability to fire.

You gain a +4 bonus to Strength, but you take a –2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You can speak but cannot drink (and thus can’t use potions) or play wind instruments. You have a penalty of -5 to concentration for spells that have somatic components.

Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club (1d6 impact damage). When you make an attack against an object or structure using your unarmed strike, you deal double damage.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 minute.
