As *Astral Caravan*, except that instead of needing to make a chain of people holding hands, you create an astral ship.

Passengers must still use *Astral Traveler*, except they only need to have one hand or foot on the astral ship.

The *Astral Ship* has an astral speed of 90 astral feet, but the time to reach a new location is the same as *Astral Caravan*.

In summary - the *Astral Ship* is easier to use for travelers, and has improved ability to escape from hostile astral pursuers.

**Augment:** If you spend 4 additional power points, then the ship's astral speed is increased to 180 astral feet. The speed of progress towards the destination is doubled, the same as an augmented *Astral Caravan*.
