**Power Points:** 3

You forge a psychometabolic affinity with an idealized animal form, thereby boosting one of your attributes (choose either Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The power grants a +4 bonus to the attribute you choose. Because you are emulating the idealized form of an animal, you also take on minor aspects of the animal you choose.

**Augment:** For every 5 additional power points you spend, this power affects an additional attribute.
