You can use this power in one of two ways: to disguise the subject’s aura (alignment) and experience level, or to remove a compulsion or charm effect from the subject.

Disguise: If you use this power to disguise the subject’s alignment and level, the power has a duration of 10 minutes per manifester level. You can change the subject’s alignment by only one step. Non-aligned is within one step of any neutral alignment. You can adjust the subject’s apparent experience level up or down by a number equal to one-half your own manifester level (rounded down) or less.

Remove Compulsion: If you use this power to attempt to cleanse the subject’s aura of a baleful or controlling effect, the duration is instantaneous. This power can remove the compulsion of a curse or a geas/quest effect. It can also negate any charm and compulsion powers of 6th circle or lower, such as *Crisis of Breath* or *Death Urge*. When aura alteration is manifested for this purpose, the subject gains another saving throw to remove the compulsion afflicting it against the original save difficulty, but with a +2 bonus.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. For every additional power point you spend, the duration of the disguise aura increases by 10 minutes.
2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the subject’s alignment shifts an additional step; if you spend 4 additional power points, the subject’s alignment changes to its opposite.
