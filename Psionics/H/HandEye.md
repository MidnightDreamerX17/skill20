You switch your vision to go through a point on your body. You can change which point of your body you are seeing through using a move action. This vision is equivalent to what you would currently be able to see with your eyes, taking into account any other vision-altering effects.

**Augment:** For each additional power point spent on the augment, you gain an additional point on your body that you can see through at once. However, for each additional point on your body that you look through, you take a penalty of -2 to checks to see fine details, faces, read lips, sense motive, search for traps, and the like. No matter how many points on your body that you use to perceive, you can never fail to spot person-sized objects, walls, and the like.
