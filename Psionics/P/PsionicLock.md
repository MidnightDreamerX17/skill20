A *Psionic Lock* manifested upon a door, chest, or portal psionically locks it. You can freely pass your own lock without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with *Psionic Lock* can be opened only by breaking in or by a successful *Dispel Psionics* effect. Add +10 to the difficulty to break open a door or portal affected by this power.
