This power shrouds your unarmed strike or a natural weapon you possess with darkness that you can use to drain an opponentâ€™s power. The power's charge can be held for a maximum number of rounds equal to your manifester level.

On a successful unarmed or natural weapon attack within the duration, the *Psychic Vampire* effect discharges. This causes the target to lose 2 power points for every manifester level you have.

Against a being that currently has no power points, the *Psychic Vampire* effect instead deals 2 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (your choice). The damage lasts for 1 day per manifester level.
