If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as claws of the beast), you can use this power to produce a mild venom that coats one of your claws. On your next successful claw attack, the venom deals 2 points of Constitution damage. A target struck by the poison can make a Constitution save to negate the Constitution damage.

This counts as a poison.

**Augment:** For every 6 additional power points you spend, this powerâ€™s Constitution damage increases by 2 points.
