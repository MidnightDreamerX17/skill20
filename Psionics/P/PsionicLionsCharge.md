You gain the powerful charging ability of a lion. You sprint for up to quadruple your movement in a straight line, gain a bonus of +10 to dodge body-blocking, then attack normally.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power as you charge. Manifesting the power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, each of your attacks after a charge in the current round gains a bonus on damage equal to the number of additional points spent.
