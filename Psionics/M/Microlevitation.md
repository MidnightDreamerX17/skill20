- **Duration:** 1 hour per manifester level (D)
- **Power Points:** 1

During the duration, you are able to move one small object around by pointing at it. You can bring it right above your finger, float it out to the maximum range of this power, or throw it. "Grabbing" a small object uses up one of your ranged attacks. Attempting to use the object as a weapon, such as flinging a shard of glass or a small razor, is considered a throwing weapon attack for 1 + Intelligence modifier damage. An object can only be used as a weapon in this manner once, after which it is embedded in the target's armor or otherwise broken.

**Augment:** For each additional power point spent on the augment, you can pick up an additional small object in the same ranged attack action for the duration.
