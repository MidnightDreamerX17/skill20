You elevate your mind to a near-universal consciousness, cogitating countless impressions and predictions involving any creature you have seen before, whether personally or by means of another power such as *Remote Viewing*.

This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision of the creatureâ€™s nature, activities, and whereabouts. When you manifest the power, you learn the following facts about the creature.

- Its name, race, alignment, and skill choices (but not exact skill levels).
- A general estimate of its experience level: low (5 or lower), medium (6 to 11), high (12 to 20), very high (21 to 40), or deific (41 or higher).
- Its location (including place of residence, town, country, world, and plane of existence).
- Significant items currently in its possession.
- Any significant activities or actions the creature has undertaken in the previous 8 hours, including details such as locales traveled through, the names or races of those the creature fought, spells it cast, items it acquired, and items it left behind (including the location of those items).
- A current mental view of the creature, as described in the remote viewing power, which you can maintain for up to 1 minute per level.

*Metafaculty* can defeat spells, powers, and special abilities such as *Screen* or *Mind Blank* (or even a *Wish* spell) that normally obscure clairsentience powers. You can attempt a caster level check (difficulty of 6 + caster level + caster attribute modifier of the creator of the obscuring effect) to defeat these sorts of otherwise impervious defenses.

*Metafaculty* is defeated by 10th+ circle powers, 10th+ circle spells, and 21st-level abilities that obscure divinations and clairsentience powers.
