You partially wipe your victim’s mind of past experiences, causing two levels of experience damage. If the subject ends up at zero current experience levels, it dies. For each level of experience damage, a psionic creature loses knowledge of one power from its highest available circle, and a number of power points from its maximum power point total sufficient to manifest that power. The effects of multiple levels of experience damage stack.

If the subject survives, it recovers from two levels of experience damage after 1 hour. (No Constitution save is necessary to avoid suffering the experience level damage permanently.)

**Augment:** You can manifest this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
2. For every 3 additional power points you spend, this power causes an additional level of experience damage on the subject.
