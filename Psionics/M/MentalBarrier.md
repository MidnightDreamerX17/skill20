You project a field of improbability around yourself, creating a fleeting protective shell. You gain a +4 bonus to Armor Class.

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power. You can use this power even when it’s not your turn; however, you must manifest it prior to an opponent’s attack roll in order to gain this power’s benefit against that attack.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. If you spend 4 additional power points, the bonus to Armor Class increases by 1.
2. For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 round.
