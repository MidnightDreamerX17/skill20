*Metaphysical Weapon* gives a weapon a +1 psionic bonus on attack accuracy rolls and damage rolls.

Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together (such as in the same quiver). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their *Metaphysical Weapon* effect when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than thrown weapons, for the purpose of this power.)

You can’t manifest this power on natural weapons. This power does work on a weapon brought into being by the *Graft Weapon* power.

**Augment:** If you spend 4 additional power points, this power’s duration increases to 1 hour per level.

In addition, for every 4 additional power points you spend, this power improves the weapon’s psionic bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls by 1.
