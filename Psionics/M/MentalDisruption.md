You generate a mental wave of confusion that instantly sweeps out from your location. All creatures you designate in the affected area (you can choose certain creatures to be unaffected) must make a Wisdom save or become *dazed* for 1 round.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s range and the radius of its area both increase by 5 feet.
