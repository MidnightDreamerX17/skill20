You send a telepathic message of up to twenty-five words to all creatures within range. You can include or exclude from this broadcast any creature you can see, as well as any creature that you know or know of. *Mass Missive* is strictly a one-way exchange from you to the subjects. If you do not share a common language, the subjects “hear” meaningless mental syllables.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s range increases by 40 feet and its save difficulty increases by 1.
