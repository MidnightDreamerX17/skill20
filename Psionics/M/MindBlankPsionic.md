The subject is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This power protects against powers with the mind-affecting or scrying descriptors. *Psionic Mind Blank* even foils *Bend Reality*, *Limited Wish*, *Miracle*, *Reality Revision*, and *Wish* when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject’s mind or to gain information about it (however, *Metafaculty* can pierce the protective quality of *Psionic Mind Blank*). In the case of *Remote Viewing* or *Scrying* that scans an area the creature is in, the effect works but the creature simply isn’t detected. *Remote Viewing* (scrying) attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
