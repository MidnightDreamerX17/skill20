You set up a trap in your mind against psionic intruders. Anyone who uses a telepathy power on you immediately loses 1d6 power points.

Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power. You can use this power even when it is not your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 round.
