You can weaken or strengthen the substance of an object or structure. You can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an object’s substance decreases its Armor Class and hit points, and strengthening it increases its Armor Class and hit points. You can increase or decrease an object’s Armor Class by up to 5 from its original. When Armor Class increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3 hit points per inch of thickness for every point of increased armor. When Armor Class decreases, the object (or portion of an object) loses 2 hit points per inch of thickness for every point of decreased armor (to a minimum of 1 hit point per inch of thickness).

You can’t decrease the Armor Class of an object that already has AC 0.

Working Manipulated Metals: An object or portion thereof whose hardness is decreased or increased is permanently changed. Even hardening adamantine to AC 25 is possible. You can also harden or weaken a preforged weapon, a suit of armor, or some other finished item.
