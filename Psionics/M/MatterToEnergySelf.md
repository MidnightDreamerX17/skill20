Choose one energy type: fire, cold, electricity, sonic, acid, or radiation.

You convert your hit points into that energy type. The maximum number of hit points that can be converted is equal to ten times your manifester level.

In exchange, you emit a burst of energy outwards from your skin. This causes an amount of damage equal to ten times the hit points spent. All matter in range outside of yourself is hit by the enrgy - creatures, objects, terrain, buildings, etc. Creatures in range can make a Dexterity save for half damage.

For every ten points of damage (1 hit point converted), 1 point of damage is caused to all matter in the next range bracket. This means that 10 hit points converted will add a third range bracket, 100 hit points converted will add a fourth range bracket, and so on.

The GM may also rule that secondary effects could occur with enough damage caused to surrounding terrain. Fire energy could create a mushroom cloud as well as a blinding flash. Cold energy could create a massive glacier. Electric energy could magnetize all rock and metal. Sonic energy could cause an earthquake. And so on.

If you convert enough hit points to send yourself to 0 HP, then your body is totally converted except for a few specks of dust. Only *True Resurrection* or similar effect that does not require your corpse can bring you back from death. The GM may also rule that something special happens to you, according to your alignment, the god(s) you worship, the way you lived, the type of energy you converted yourself into, etc.
