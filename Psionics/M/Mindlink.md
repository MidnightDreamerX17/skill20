You forge a telepathic bond with your target. You can communicate telepathically through the bond even if you do not share a common language. The bond only allows communication of speech and intent. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.

1. **Unwilling** - If you spend 4 additional power points for the *Unwilling* augment, you can attempt to create a telepathic bond with a creature that is not willing (Wisdom save negates).
2. **Additional Links** For every additional power point you spend on the *Additional Links* augment, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.
3. **All Senses** - If you spend 6 additional power points for the *All Senses* augment, you can communicate all senses through the power.
