[Schism](/Psionics/S/Schism.md) - Circle 5, Telepath, Telepathy

- **Circle:** 5
- **Category:** Telepath

- **Display:** Auditory and visual
- **Map Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 round per manifester level (D)
- **Power Points:** 7

Your mind splits into two independent parts. Each part functions in complete autonomy, like two characters in one body. Your new “second mind” does not control your body physically but is free to take one standard action in each round if the action is purely mental (such as manifesting a power) in the same round you take your normal actions.

Your second mind can manifest powers using your power point reserve, but only as if your manifester level were six lower than it is. Your second mind doesn't need to make concentration checks, because all pain and other such effects are only experienced by your first mind.

Your second mind takes its first action on your turn in the round after *Schism* is manifested.

Both your minds communicate with each other telepathically. If you are subject to a compulsion or charm effect while you are of two minds, make a second saving throw if you fail the first. If you fail both, then the *Schism* ends and you are affected normally by the power. If you fail just one, the schism ends immediately, but you are not subject to the compulsion or charm.

Your second mind does not gain any advantages if you are subject to a *Haste* effect, although your first mind does.
