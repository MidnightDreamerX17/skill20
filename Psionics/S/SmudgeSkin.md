You alter one square inch of your skin per manifester level.

If this power is used to remove impurities, then the impurities are brought to the outside of your skin. For example, if you remove a tattoo, then the tattoo ink comes out as if someone had just splashed ink on you, and you will probably have to wipe it off afterwards.

If this power is used to add impurities, then they must be put onto the outside of your skin before using the power. For example, if you add a nonpsionic tattoo, then you will need to rub ink onto that part of the skin beforehand.

This power cannot be used to add psionic tattoos - that can only be done with proper use of Craft (Psionic Focuses) (INT) skill.
