# Strength of My Enemy

[Strength of My Enemy](/Psionics/S/StrengthOfMyEnemy.md) - Circle 3, Warrior, Psychometabolism

- **Circle:** 3
- **Category:** Warrior
- **Discipline:** Psychometabolism
- **Display:** Visual; see text
- **Map Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 round per manifester level (D)
- **Power Points:** 3

You gain the ability to siphon away your enemy’s strength for your own use. Your melee attacks become the instrument of your desire, and deal 1 point of Strength damage on each successful hit. You gain that point of Strength as a temporary bonus to your Strength score. Strength you siphon from different foes is tracked separately — the total siphoned from each individual foe is considered a separate bonus to your Strength, and you gain only the highest total.

When the duration of the power ends, the strength damage from this power also ends, and you lose the drained strength.

**Augment:** If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action.
