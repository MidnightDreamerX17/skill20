You, another willing creature, or an unattended object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If you manifest *Skate* on yourself or another creature, the subject of the power retains equilibrium by mental desire alone, allowing her to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly as desired. The skater’s land speed increases by 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) As with any effect that increases speed, this power affects the subject’s maximum horizontal jumping distance.

The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline she could normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up an incline reduces the subject’s speed to normal, while skating down a decline increases her speed by an additional 15 feet.

If you manifest *Skate* on an object, treat the object as having only one-tenth of its normal weight for the purpose of dragging it along the ground.
