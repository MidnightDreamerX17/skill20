This power can negate a *Psionic Mind Blank* or a *Personal Mind Blank* affecting the target. If the target fails its save and does not overcome your attempt with its Power Resistance, you can shatter the mind blank by making a successful check (1d20 + your manifester level) against a difficulty equal to 11 + the manifester level of the creator of the mind blank effect. If you succeed, the *Psionic Mind Blank* or *Personal Mind Blank*  ends, allowing you to affect the target thereafter with mind-affecting powers.
