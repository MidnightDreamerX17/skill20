Your familiar psicrystal takes over the responsibility of maintaining concentration on any single power you have manifested and are concentrating on. While maintaining this concentration, the familiar psicrystal is limited to move actions in each round, as normal. When the duration of *Solicit Psicrystal* expires, the power you transferred to the familiar psicrystal ends (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal). If necessary, the familiar psicrystal makes Concentration checks using your attributes and skills.

You can manifest this power (and transfer the responsibility) with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power before you take any other actions in a round. Manifesting the power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s maximum duration increases by 1 round.
