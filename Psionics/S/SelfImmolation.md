Choose one energy type: fire, cold, electricity, sonic, or acid. You take 1d6 points of damage of the chosen element each round. Every time you perform a successful melee attack, you add 1d6 points of damage of the chosen element to the attack.

If grappling an opponent (or being grappled by it), you automatically deal 1d6 damage to that opponent each round.

The source of the energy is inside your body, so it can only be reduced by racial abilities, potions, and other effects that are inside your body.

**Augment:** For each additional power point spent on the augment, all damage from this power increases by 1d6.
