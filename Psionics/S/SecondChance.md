You take a hand in influencing the probable outcomes of your immediate environment. You see the many alternative branches that reality could take in the next few seconds, and with this foreknowledge you gain the ability to reroll one d20 roll each round. You must take the result of the reroll, even if itâ€™s worse than the original roll. You do not have to make another roll if satisfied with your original roll.
