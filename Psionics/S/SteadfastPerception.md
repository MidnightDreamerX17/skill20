Your vision cannot be distracted or misled, granting you immunity to all figments and glamers (such as invisibility). Moreover, your visual spotting and searching checks receive a +6 bonus for the duration of this power. This power also grants you another saving throw against someone using *False Sensory Input* on you, but you must realize that that power has been used in order to know enough to manifest *Steadfast Perception* if you did not already have it activated.
