You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand—mundane, psionic, or magical—onto the end of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft, hilt, or head of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 bonus on all attack accuracy and damage rolls while using the weapon.

The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for all purposes that could benefit you. For example, if you have the Chi Fist (CON) skill, then you can use both Iron Fist and Weapon Channelling at the same time.

For a character under the effect of the *Claws of the Beast* power, grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the weapon, instead of the claw.

While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of regenerate or a similar effect).

When this power’s duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand returns.
