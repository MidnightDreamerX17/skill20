You can improve your chances in a grapple as an immediate action, gaining a +4 bonus on your grapple checks.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power in the current round. Manifesting this power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power. You can manifest this power when it isnâ€™t your turn (if you are grappled).

**Augment:** For every 4 additional power points you spend, the bonus on your grapple checks increases by 2.
