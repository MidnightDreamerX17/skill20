You are almost impossible to move. Your weight does not vary; instead, you mentally attach yourself to the underlying fabric of the plane. Thus, you could conceivably anchor yourself in midair. Any creature attempting to physically move you must succeed on an opposed Strength check, and you gain a +20 bonus on the check. You canâ€™t voluntarily move to a new location unless you stop concentrating, which ends the power.

You cannot apply your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class; however, your anchored body shifts damage downwards into the ground. You can choose to shift up to 15 points of damage per round into the ground, and make the choices upon receiving the damage. If you are standing on a person, the damage passes through until it hits the ground.

You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale movements (you can make smallscale movements, such as breathing, turning your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on). Teleportation and telekinetic powers manifested on you automatically fail.

**Augment:** If you spend 8 additional power points, you can manifest this power as an immediate action. You can use the augmented power as a reaction, even when it isn't your turn.
