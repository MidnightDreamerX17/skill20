Your mind generates a tangible field of force that provides a +4 bonus to Armor Class. Because *Inertial Armor* is composed of psychokinetic force, incorporeal creatures canâ€™t bypass it the way they do normal armor.

*Inertial Armor* has an armor weight of 4.

Your *Inertial Armor* can be invisible or can appear as a colored glow, at your option.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, the armor bonus to Armor Class increases by 1.
