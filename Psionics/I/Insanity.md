As the *Confusion* spell, except as noted here. 

Creatures affected by this power are permanently confused and constantly behave randomly.

Only *Psychic Chirurgery*, *Reality Revision*, and other similarly extreme measures can restore the subject’s sanity.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.
