As the *Confusion* spell, except as noted here.

Swift tendrils of thought disrupt the unconscious mind of any one creature, sapping its might. As long as the manifester remains concentrating fully on this power, the subject is *confused*, making it unable to independently determine it will do.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this powerâ€™s save difficulty increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.
