You can affect a foe by concentrating your mind upon its current status and the status you desire, once per round. You can perform a bull rush, a disarm, a grapple (including a pin), or a trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that you use your manifester level in place of your fighting skills (for disarm and grapple attempts), and you use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but power resistance applies normally.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +1 bonus on your checks involving bull rush, disarm, grapple, or trip attempts.
