You generate a subtle telekinetic field of mental contact, allowing you to “feel” your surroundings even in total darkness or when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your *Touchsight* field emanates from you out to 60 feet. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though you must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You do not need to make perception checks to notice creatures; you can detect and pinpoint all creatures within 60 feet. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with *Touchsight* is enough to tell you the difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, the radius of your *Touchsight* field increases by 10 feet.
