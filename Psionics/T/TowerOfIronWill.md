You generate a bastion of thought so strong that it offers protection to you and everyone around you, improving the self-control of all. You and all creatures in the power’s area gain Power Resistance 19 against all mindaffecting powers. Those who already have Power Resistance instead get a bonus of +5 against mindaffecting powers.

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power. You can use this power even when it is not your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 round and the power resistance it provides increases by 1 point.
