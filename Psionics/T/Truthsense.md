The subject must be in audible conversation, typically with the manifester. A Wisdom save prevents this power from activating. For the duration of the power, the manifester can determine whether a statement made by the creature is a falsehood. The actual information about the statement is not revealed, only that the statement is false. The manifester can detect as many falsehoods as their Intelligence modifier + 1 falsehood per 3 manifester levels.

The power lasts for the above mentioned duration or until the maximum number of falsehoods is reached, after which it fades.
