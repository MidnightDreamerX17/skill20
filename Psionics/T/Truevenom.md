If you have a natural weapon that does puncture or slashing damage (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as *Claws of the Beast*), you can use this power to produce a horrible poison that coats one of your claws. On your next successful melee attack with the natural weapon during the powerâ€™s duration, the poison deals 1d8 points of Constitution damage immediately and another 1d8 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. The target of your attack can negate each instance of damage with a Constitution save.
