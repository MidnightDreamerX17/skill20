This power creates a number of force palms equal to the manifester's Intelligence score plus 10. Each force palm is a highly-visible glowing object shaped like the manifester's hand. Each force palm flies out and attempts to hit one target of the manifester's choosing. All force palms can be directed at one target, or every single force palm can be directed at a different target, or any other ratio in between.

Each force palm does 1 point of physical impact damage.

Each target may make a Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage received in total. It can be inferred that such a saving throw is only useful if at least two force palms are directed at the target.

**Augment:** This power can have one or more of the following augments applied.

- Additional Force Palms - Each power point spent on this augment increases the number of force palms by 4, but decreases the save difficulty by 1.
- Faster Force Palms - Every two power points spent on this augment increases the save difficulty by 1.
