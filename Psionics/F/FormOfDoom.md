You wrench from your subconscious a terrifying visage of deadly hunger and become one with it. You are transformed into a nightmarish version of yourself, complete with an ooze-sleek skin coating, lashing tentacles, and a fright-inducing countenance. You effectively gain a +10 bonus on disguise checks to conceal your true appearance, though you retain your basic shape and can continue to use your equipment. This power cannot be used to impersonate someone; while horrible, your form is recognizably your own.

You gain a special effect when performing charge attacks. Opponents within 30 feet of you that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than you and that witness your charge become *shaken* for 5d6 rounds if they fail a Wisdom save (difficulty of 16 + your experience level + your Charisma modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the special effect from *Form of Doom* charge attacks for 24 hours. This is a mind-altering effect.

Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +10, and a +20 bonus to your Strength score. In addition, you gain +10 feet to your land speed.

A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and back. You can make up to four additional attacks with these tentacles in addition to your regular melee attacks in each round. The tentacles are melee natural weapons that deal 2d8 + Strength modifier points of impact damage.

This power functions only while you are not metamorphed, polymorphed, shapechanged, etc. and while your mind resides within your own body.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this powerâ€™s duration increases by 2 rounds.
