You create a permanent Level 0 psicrystal creature, whose core is a psicrystal made of ectoplasm. The psicrystal creature is capable of flying 30 feet per move action.

It functions much like a magical familiar from the *Find Familiar* spell, except when dismissing it to a pocket plane. Instead, dismissal sends it to either the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, with a preference for the Astral.
