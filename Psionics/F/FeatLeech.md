You can use another’s Metapsionics (INT) skill and feats requiring Psionic Power (INT) skill for yourself. You make a melee attack against a target. If successful, you can choose a number of feats to “leech” equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one).

While the power lasts, you are treated as if you possessed the stolen skill and feats, despite the fact that you have more feats than normally allowed. During this same period, the target can make no use of the stolen skill or feats. When the power’s duration expires, you lose access to the skill and feats, and the target gains immediate use of them. This transfer occurs regardless of the distance between you and the target.

If the duration of *Feat Leech* is extended by the use of Metapsionics (INT) skill, the target gains a Wisdom saving throw every 10 minutes beyond the normal duration. If this save succeeds, the power’s duration ends. If the target is killed before the duration expires, you immediately lose the benefit of the stolen skill and feats.

You must have the Psionic Power (INT) skill to use any feats that require it.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save difficulty increases by 1.
