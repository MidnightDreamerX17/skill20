You create an invisible mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. The *Force Screen* provides a +4 bonus to Armor Class to your front (which applies against incorporeal enemies, since the *Force Screen* is psionic). Since it hovers in front of you, it does not take any hands or concentration.

**Augment:** For every 4 additional power points you spend, the bonus to Armor Class improves by 1.
