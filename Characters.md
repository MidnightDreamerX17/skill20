## Character Creation Procedure

1. Choose a [race](/Races).
2. Choose a plane of origin.
3. Choose [Traits](/Traits.md). Advantages and Disadvantages must balance out. A maximum of 5 Quirks can be chosen, with Alignment Quirks being mutually exclusive.
4. Determine attribute numbers.
5. Choose 1 [Craft](/Skills/SkillDetails/Craft.md) skill
6. Choose 1 [Knowledge](/Skills/SkillDetails/Knowledge.md) skill
7. Choose 1 [Perform](/Skills/SkillDetails/Perform.md) skill
8. Choose 1 [Profession](/Skills/SkillDetails/Profession.md) skill
9. Choose 6 additional starting [skills](/Skills).
10. All starting skills start at 100 XP (Skill Level 1).
11. Choose [Languages](/Languages.md). All characters start with a number of languages equal to 1 + their Intelligence modifier. If the character's Intelligence modifier is -1, then they are illiterate. If the character's Intelligence modifier is -2, then they start talking dumb. If the character's Intelligence modifier is -3, then they randomly shout words that make no sense. If the character's Intelligence modifier is -4 then they cannot even understand exaggerated facial expressions or body language.
12. If the character starts with magic skills which require a spellbook, then they start with as many spells in their spellbook as they are able to memorize.
13. Start with a 200 gold loan provided by Adventure Capital. This loan needs to be repaid with additional interest of 50 gold within 60 days of the game's start time.

**Note on Magic Skills:** Having a **Potential** skill by itself will not grant the ability to cast those spells normally. Having a **Power** skill by itself will not grant the ability to memorize them normally. Therefore, replicating normal D&D spellcasting ability requires both a **Potential** and **Power** skill. It is still possible to do things like:

- Have only Wizard Power (INT), and memorize spells from a library of Books of One Spell. Being a member of a guild that possesses such a library would make this lifestyle less expensive.
- Have only Cleric Power (WIS), and rely on Warlock Pacts (CHA) for access to spells.
- Have only Druid Potential (WIS) just for the shapechanging.
- The GM could remove **Power** skills entirely, leaving the **Potential** skills as representations of various types of secret lore.

## Attributes

There are six attributes.

- Strength (STR)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Constitution (CON)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Wisdom (WIS)
- Charisma (CHA)

There are many possible methods of determining attribute numbers. The GM chooses a method, and all Player Characters are then made with that method.

1. Method 1: Roll six sets of 3d6, and assign them in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
2. Method 2: Roll six sets of 3d6, and assign each set to one attribute of your choosing. Each attribute must get exactly one set.
3. Method 3: Roll six sets of 4d6, drop the lowest die from each set, and assign each set to one attribute of your choosing. Each attribute must get exactly one set.
4. Method 4: Roll nine sets of 4d6, drop the lowest die from each set, drop the three lowest sets, and assign each remaining set to one attribute of your choosing. Each attribute must get exactly one set.
5. Method 5: Roll 5d6 six times, and drop the lowest two dice of each, then choose the order.
6. Method 6: Roll 2d6+6 six times, and choose the order.
7. Method 7: Assign the following numbers: 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6
8. Method 8: Roll 18 dice, then group them up into 6 triplets. Assign each triplet to an attribute.
9. Method 9: Roll 24 dice, drop the lowest six dice, then group up the remaining 18 dice into 6 triplets. Assign each triplet to an attribute.
10. Method 10: Allow the players to write whatever attribute numbers they want, up to a maximum of 18 per attribute. The GM then chooses whether to approve each set of numbers. This method is based on the idea that the GM can write in whatever monsters they want, and having attributes of all 18 is equivalent to having only 2 more experience levels.

The most common method for attribute numbers is Method 4, but the method is ultimately decided by the GM.

Attribute numbers cause bonuses or penalties to d20 rolls based on attributes. These are called the "*modifiers*" of the attributes. For example, with a Strength number of 16, the "*Strength Modifier*" is +3.

| Number | Modifier |
| ---    | ---      |
| 0      | automatically-fail checks
| 1      | -5
| 2 - 3  | -4
| 4 - 5  | -3
| 6 - 7  | -2
| 8 - 9  | -1
| 10 - 11 | no modifier
| 12 - 13 | +1
| 14 - 15 | +2
| 16 - 17 | +3
| 18 - 19 | +4
| 20 - 21 | +5
| 22 - 23 | +6

Frequently, attribute *modifiers* are called for. Whether for d20 rolls or for other purposes. It is rare that the attribute number itself is used, except for initiative order in combat.

If only an attribute *bonus* is called for, rather than the *modifier*, then it means that negative modifiers are considered "no modifier" for that case.

If an attribute *number* or *score* is called for, then the entire number (usually between 3 to 18) is used. Currently, there are at least two cases you would need to use the *number*, rather than the *modifier* or *bonus* for:

- **Dexterity number** is used for initiative rolls
- **Constitution number** affects starting hit points

## Statistics

### Hit Points

Hit Points are heroic energy that holds the character's body together and alive, despite being chopped up, burnt to a crisp, and losing a lot of blood. If two characters lose 100 hit points, one dies, and one lives, then the one that survived simply has that much more blood and other heroic energy in their body holding them together by supernatural means. Some characters' Hit Points are primarily in supernatural efficiency of flesh, bones, and amount of blood - this is more common among thick, stout, and/or tall individuals. Other characters' Hit Points are primarily in a life energy field that surrounds all their important organs and generates blood in order to fill in damaged areas - this is more common amongst skinny, lean, and/or short individuals.

Hit Points start as the character's Constitution number + 1d6. For example, a character with a Constitution number of 14 will start with 14+1d6 maximum Hit Points.

When Hit Points are at 0 or below, then the character starts losing 1 Hit Point per round (10 seconds) and falls unconscious. When Hit Points are lower than the character's full negative Constitution score, then they are dead.

### Experience Points

Experience Points are a representation of the favor of the gods, the machinations of the fates, the growing of the destiny, the length of heroic legends ascribed to the character, the character's own heroic confidence, and other such things that cause characters to stand out and become greater than the average person. They are granted for accomplishing great tasks, slaying fearsome monsters, rediscovering long-lost treasures, achieving deep understanding of the world, approaching enlightenment, making the world a better or worse place, and other significant endeavors.

Experience Points must then be allocated to the character's skills, growing the character in concrete ways.

### Skill Level

The skill level of each skill is determined by the number of experience points allocated to it, according to the following table:

| LVL    | XP    | LVL    | XP    | LVL    | XP     |
| ---    | ---   | ---    | ---   | ---    | ---    |
| **1**  | 100   | **21** | 23100 | **41** | 86100  |
| **2**  | 300   | **22** | 25300 | **42** | 90300  |
| **3**  | 600   | **23** | 27600 | **43** | 94600  |
| **4**  | 1000  | **24** | 30000 | **44** | 99000  |
| **5**  | 1500  | **25** | 32500 | **45** | 103500 |
| **6**  | 2100  | **26** | 35100 | **46** | 108100 |
| **7**  | 2800  | **27** | 37800 | **47** | 112800 |
| **8**  | 3600  | **28** | 40600 | **48** | 117600 |
| **9**  | 4500  | **29** | 43500 | **49** | 122500 |
| **10** | 5500  | **30** | 46500 | **50** | 127500 |
| **11** | 6600  | **31** | 49600 | **51** | 132600 |
| **12** | 7800  | **32** | 52800 | **52** | 137800 |
| **13** | 9100  | **33** | 56100 | **53** | 143100 |
| **14** | 10500 | **34** | 59500 | **54** | 148500 |
| **15** | 12000 | **35** | 63000 | **55** | 154000 |
| **16** | 13600 | **36** | 66600 | **56** | 159600 |
| **17** | 15300 | **37** | 70300 | **57** | 165300 |
| **18** | 17100 | **38** | 74100 | **58** | 171100 |
| **19** | 19000 | **39** | 78000 | **59** | 177000 |
| **20** | 21000 | **40** | 82000 | **60** | 183000 |

There is no limit to skill level, but it is considered highly unlikely that level 61 would be reached for any skill.

Since experience level cannot be higher than the tenth-highest skill level, the numbers in the table can be multiplied by 10 to determine the minimum XP required to gain experience levels. It is expected that most characters will need more XP than that, as some of their XP will be spent on buying additional skills.

### Experience Level

A character's Experience Level is equal to that of their tenth-highest skill level. This means that characters must invest their experience points into at least ten different skills to increase their Experience Level.

At every Experience Level after the first, the character's maximum Hit Points are increased by 1d6 + Constitution modifier. It is possible that characters with 7 or less Constitution will lose maximum Hit Points after their first Experience Level.

Whenever the character's Constitution is increased, they reroll all of their Hit Points. They then choose whether to use their old maximum Hit Points or the new roll.

### Optional: Skills Capped by Experience Level

The effective level of a skill can never exceed the character's Experience Level. This means that characters need to advance at least ten skills at the same time in order to get any benefit from advancing them. This rule is recommended for GMs who want to avoid certain problems that could be caused by putting all experience points into a few skills.

### Optional: Two Types of Advancement Points

This rule works best with the "Skills Capped By Experience Level" rule, and should not be used by itself. Two different types of advancement points are awarded: experience points and skill points. Experience points go towards advancing the character's Experience Level, while skill points go towards advancing skills as normal. Experience Level requires 10 times the number of points to advance as a skill - for example, it takes 3,000 experience points to reach Experience Level 2.

### Optional: Class-Style Advancement

If a character learns a new skill, then they cannot advance any other skill until the new skill is raised to the same level as the others. Combined with the "Skills Capped by Experience Level" rule, this means that characters with many skills will take a long time to gain experience levels compared to those who do not learn any. This rule is only provided for GMs who also want to allow characters to be able to gain experience levels while advancing fewer than ten skills.

### Optional: Training Required for Skill Advancement

Characters must spend a number of days training equal to their next skill level. This is in addition to the expenditure of experience points. For example, advancing the Melee Fighting (STR) skill from 6 to 7 would require 7 days of training. The GM may additionally require guild facilities, skilled training partners, blessings from the gods, and the like.

### Optional: Attribute Improvements With Experience

Characters gain one attribute point at every 4th experience level.
