# Projectile Arts (DEX)

Projectile Arts are just as supernatural as magic, psionics, and chi. They may well be just a special variant of magic, psionics, and/or chi. The GM may even rule that Projectile Arts derive their power from specific gods, ancient runestones, gems implanted in the body, gems socketed into equipment, magic scrolls of techniques, or other source. See also the Battle Arts (STR) skill. However it is that Battle Arts function and are learned, Projectile Arts will work the same way.

**Projectile Arts Stamina:** You have a Projectile Arts Stamina pool whose maximum size is equal to your Projectile Arts (DEX) skill level plus your Dexterity modifier. For example, if you have a Projectile Arts (DEX) level of 5, and 16 Dexterity, then your maximum Projectile Arts Stamina is 8.

Projectile Arts Stamina normally recovers at a rate of 1 per ten minutes. 8 hours of contiguous uninterrupted sleep will fully restore it.
