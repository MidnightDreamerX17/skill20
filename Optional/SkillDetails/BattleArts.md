# Battle Arts (STR)

Battle Arts are just as supernatural as magic, psionics, and chi. They may well be just a special variant of magic, psionics, and/or chi. The GM may even rule that Battle Arts derive their power from specific gods, ancient runestones, gems implanted in the body, gems socketed into equipment, magic scrolls of techniques, or other source.

**Examples of sources of Battle Arts:**

- **Ancient Runestones** - Each Battle Art and Battle Aura is contained entirely inside an ancient runestone. You must touch and successfully-read the runestone to permanently gain knowledge of the art or aura.
- **Gems Implanted in the Body** - Each Battle Art and Battle Aura is contained entirely inside a gem. You can have a maximum number of gems implanted in your body equal to half of your Constitution number.
- **Gems Socketed Into Equipment** - Each piece of equipment has a maximum possible number of sockets equal to its magical or psionic reinforcement. For example, a Longsword +2 has a maximum of two sockets. Arts can only be combined if they are socketed into the same piece of equipment.
- **Magic Scrolls of Techniques** - Each Battle Art and Battle Aura is found only in a magic scroll of technique. Upon successfully reading such a scroll, you learn the art or aura, and the scroll disintegrates.

**Battle Arts Stamina:** You have a Battle Arts Stamina pool whose maximum size is equal to your Battle Arts (STR) skill level plus your Constitution modifier. For example, if you have a Battle Arts (STR) level of 5, and 16 Constitution, then your maximum Battle Arts Stamina is 8.

Battle Arts Stamina normally recovers at a rate of 1 per ten minutes. 8 hours of contiguous uninterrupted sleep will fully restore it.

**Reserving Stamina:** Battle Auras consume and reserve a percentage of maximum stamina when turned on. When an aura is turned off, the stamina it consumed is not refunded.

**Example of Reserving Stamina:** Your current stamina is 5, and your maximum stamina is 10. You activate Health Aura, so your current stamina goes down to 2, and your maximum stamina goes down to 7. When you deactivate the Health Aura, your maximum stamina goes back to 10, but your current stamina is still at 2.
