# Optional Sections

**[Feats](/Optional/Feats.md)** - More bits for customizing character rules, beyond skill allocation. The feats system should only be used if both the GM and the players are very comfortable with the existing rules, and enjoy spending long amounts of time optimizing characters and balancing monsters.
