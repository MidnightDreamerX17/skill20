# Optional Sections

**[Feats](/Optional/Feats.md)** - More bits for customizing character rules, beyond skill allocation. The feats system should only be used if both the GM and the players are very comfortable with the existing rules, and enjoy spending long amounts of time optimizing characters and balancing monsters.

## Optional Skills

- [Battle Arts (STR)](/Optional/SkillDetails/BattleArts.md) - A magic/psionic/chi type skill that is themed around melee fighting. It is just as supernatural of a power as magic, psionics, and chi.
- [Projectile Arts (DEX)](/Optional/SkillDetails/ProjectileArts.md) - A magic/psionic/chi type skill that is themed around ranged fighting. It is just as supernatural of a power as magic, psionics, and chi.

## Socketed Gear

First, determine gold value based on the total number of sockets.

| Sockets | Added Gold Value |
| ---     | ---              |
| 1       | 500
| 2       | 1,000
| 3       | 4,500
| 4       | 8,000
| 5       | 12,500
| 6       | 18,000

Then, add gold value based on the longest link.

| Longest Link | Added Gold Value |
| ---          | ---              |
| 2            | 1,600
| 3            | 8,100
| 4            | 25,600
| 5            | 62,500
| 6            | 129,600
