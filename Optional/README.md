# Optional Sections

**[Feats](/Optional/Feats.md)** - More bits for customizing character rules, beyond skill allocation. The feats system should only be used if both the GM and the players are very comfortable with the existing rules, and enjoy spending long amounts of time optimizing characters and balancing monsters.

## Optional Skills

- [Battle Arts (STR)](/Optional/SkillDetails/BattleArts.md) - A magic/psionic/chi type skill that is themed around melee fighting. It is just as supernatural of a power as magic, psionics, and chi.
- [Projectile Arts (DEX)](/Optional/SkillDetails/ProjectileArts.md) - A magic/psionic/chi type skill that is themed around ranged fighting. It is just as supernatural of a power as magic, psionics, and chi.

- [Mana From Intelligence (INT)](/Optional/SkillDetails/ManaFromIntelligence.md) - Used for the Gem System.
- [Mana From Wisdom (WIS)](/Optional/SkillDetails/ManaFromWisdom.md) - Used for the Gem System.

## Gem System

The Gem System is intended to give characters a few extra "spell"-equivalents per day, at the cost of further skill investment and a significant amount of gold investment.

Mana naturally regenerates at a rate of 1 per 10 minutes (60 rounds).

**Techniques** are actions. Many of them are either specializations that are applied to your normal weapon attack, or are a new weapon in themselves.

**Supports** mostly provide utility by being linked to Techniques. A few support gems may specify that they affect auras instead.

**Auras** require one round each to activate or deactivate. When an Aura is activated, it reduces maximum mana according to a specific percentage. When an Aura is deactivated, current mana is not refunded.

### Potions for the Gem System

Potion effects do not stack. The best potion effect takes precedence.

The gold value of a gem is determined by the following table:

| LVL    | Gold  | LVL    | Gold  |
| ---    | ---   | ---    | ---   |
| **1**  |    50 | **21** | 11550 |
| **2**  |   150 | **22** | 12650 |
| **3**  |   300 | **23** | 13800 |
| **4**  |   500 | **24** | 15000 |
| **5**  |   750 | **25** | 16250 |
| **6**  |  1050 | **26** | 17550 |
| **7**  |  1400 | **27** | 18900 |
| **8**  |  1800 | **28** | 20300 |
| **9**  |  2250 | **29** | 21750 |
| **10** |  2750 | **30** | 23250 |
| **11** |  3300 | **31** | 24800 |
| **12** |  3900 | **32** | 26400 |
| **13** |  4550 | **33** | 28050 |
| **14** |  5250 | **34** | 29750 |
| **15** |  6000 | **35** | 31500 |
| **16** |  6800 | **36** | 33300 |
| **17** |  7650 | **37** | 35150 |
| **18** |  8550 | **38** | 37050 |
| **19** |  9500 | **39** | 39000 |
| **20** | 10500 | **40** | 41000 |

Gem levels higher than 40 are possible, but are considered highly unlikely. Since they require that their associated attributes be equally as high to use.

### Socketed Gear

First, determine gold value based on the total number of sockets.

| Sockets | Added Gold Value |
| ---     | ---              |
| 1       | 500
| 2       | 1,000
| 3       | 4,500
| 4       | 8,000
| 5       | 12,500
| 6       | 18,000
| 7       | 24,500
| 8       | 32,000

Then, add gold value based on the longest link.

| Longest Link | Added Gold Value |
| ---          | ---              |
| 2            | 1,600
| 3            | 8,100
| 4            | 25,600
| 5            | 62,500
| 6            | 129,600
| 7            | 240,100
| 8            | 409,600
