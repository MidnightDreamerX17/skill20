# Green Gems (Dexterity-based)

Green Gems require a Dexterity number of at least the gem's level.

## Gem Attacks

Ballista Summon (4 mana) (Magic Totem) - Summons an intelligent ballista creature that lasts for (Gem Level / 2) rounds, for a minimum of 1 round. It has an AC of 10 + (Gem Level / 2). It has 2 * Gem Level HP. It attacks with the same ranged weapons and skills that you have. It can attack in the same round that it is summoned in.

Ballistic Projectile (1 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Attack is aimed at a five-foot square. It is sent upwards in the air. At the beginning of your next turn, it falls downwards onto the target area, attempting to hit all enemies in the area. This attack adds Gem Level to accuracy.

Blink Projectile (3 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Attack, then teleport to the location hit by the projectile. The cost is paid per attack that has Blink Projectile applied. The maximum teleport range is (Gem Level * 20) feet.

Decoy Projectile (3 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Attack, and a decoy clone of you is created at the location hit by the projectile. This decoy clone can appear to do anything that you are capable of, except that no effects actually occur from its actions. It appears to move by the same means that you do. It starts with Gem Level * 2 HP. It lives for a number of rounds equal to Gem Level.

Double Strike (3 mana) (Melee Attack) - Convert a normal melee attack into two melee attacks.

Evasion Stance (3 mana) (Stance) - You enter Evasion Stance, which adds gem level to your AC. You also gain a bonus of (Gem Level / 2) to Dexterity saving throws while the stance is maintained. Doing any other action instantly cancels Evasion Stance.

Frenzy Attack (2 mana) (Attack) - Attack, and gain a Frenzy Charge on hit. Accuracy is increased by (Gem Level / 2), for a minimum of +1 accuracy.

Imbued Projectile (1 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Cast a spell and imbue it into the projectile. When the projectile hits something, the spell takes effect as if it were centered on the projectile's tip. This uses up all attacks in the round. Accuracy is increased by Gem Level.

Phase Projectile (1 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Attack that goes through the Ethereal Plane until it reaches its target.

Projectile Nova (5 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Attack all enemies within half of the first range increment of the weapon. Accuracy is increased by Gem Level.

Seeker Projectile (1 mana) (Ranged Attack) - Attack that does not need to be in a straight line, nor does it require line of sight. It can go around corners, into pipes, and the like.

Speedy Strike (3 mana) (Melee One-Handed Attack) - You gain an extra move action, then perform one of your melee attacks.

Wall of Strikes (special mana cost) (Melee One-Handed Puncture/Slash Attack) - The mana cost is equal to 2 * the number of attacks you normally have in one round. You attack double the number of times, and each attack targets all enemies who are 5 feet in front of you. The damage is halved. In map-less combat, this targets three enemies in the front row. Usage of this gem requires that you use all melee attacks in the round on it.
