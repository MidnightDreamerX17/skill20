# Brown Gems (Constitution-based)

Brown Gems require a Constitution number of at least the gem's level.

## Gem Techniques

Brace (2 mana) (Reaction) - In response to one action - increase AC by (Gem Level / 2), and cut physical damage in half.

Chest / Hip Attack (2 mana) (Melee Two-Handed Impact Attack) - Attack, and the weapon is your own body. This is considered a two-handed impact weapon, and the amount of damage is equal to your Armor Class.

Decoy Totem (3 mana) (Magic Totem) - Creates a magical totem with the same Armor Class and skills that you have. It has 5 * Gem Level HP. It lasts for (Gem Level / 2) rounds, for a minimum of 1 round. It occupies a full 5-foot square and is 10 feet tall.

Enduring Cry (3 mana) (Warcry) - You and all allies who can hear you gain (Gem Level / 5) Endurance Charges, for a minimum of 1 Endurance Charge.

Regeneration Stance (5 mana) (Stance) - You enter Regeneration Stance, which renders you helpless. You regain (Gem Level / 5) hit points per round while maintaining the stance, for a minimum of 1 hit point per round. Taking any other action will automatically end the stance.

Self-Immolation Stance (2 mana) (Stance) - You enter Self-Immolation Stance, which burns a number of hit points per round equal to Gem Level. In exchange, an equal amount of fire damage is done to all enemies within 25 feet + 5 feet per two gem levels. Self-Immolation Stance can be cancelled as part of your move action.

Shield Charge (2 mana) (Melee Attack) - Move in a straight line, then attack with your shield, dealing an amount of impact damage equal to the amount of AC that your shield provides. Accuracy is increased by (Gem Level / 2), for a minimum of +1 accuracy.

## Gem Supports

Fortify Support - Costs an amount of mana equal to (Gem Level / 4), for a minimum of 1 mana. Linked attacks also cause Fortify status to yourself for 2 rounds per mana cost. The Fortify status increases Armor Class by 1. Additional applications of Fortify only refresh the duration, and do not stack.

Life Gain on Hit Support - Costs an amount of mana equal to (Gem Level / 3), for a minimum of 1 mana. You regain 1 HP per mana cost, for each damaging hit of linked attacks.

Life-to-Damage Support - Costs an amount of mana equal to Gem Level. Linked attacks burn an amount of hit points equal to double the mana cost, in order to add that much damage to each hit.

Constitution Save Aura (30%) - You and all allies gain a bonus of (Gem Level / 3) to Constitution saving throws.

Enmity Aura (20%) - You count as (Gem Level / 2) additional targets for the purposes of enemies randomly deciding who to attack. You count as a minimum of 1 additional target. One can imagine that this is less effective in line battles and other melee situations.

Health Aura (50%) - You and all allies regenerate (Gem Level / 5) hit points per round. The minimum regeneration is 1 hit point per round.
