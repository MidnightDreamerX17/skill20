# Armor Training (CON)

Armor Training sets the maximum amount of Armor Weight that can be borne without penalty, before magic modifiers and other modifiers are taken into account. The Armor Weight is tracked separately for body armor and shields. For example, Armor Training Level 10 allows a character to wear Steel Full Plate AC 10 and use a Steel Tower Shield AC 5 without penalty.

Having Armor Weight above the character's Armor Training Level causes a penalty to all physical actions and cancels-out the Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.
