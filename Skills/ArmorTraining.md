# Armor Training (CON)

Armor Training sets the maximum amount of AC that can be gained by wearing armor without penalty, before magic modifiers and other modifiers are taken into account. It also allows the character to use shields with an AC of up to half of the character's Armor Training Level without penalty. For example, Armor Training Level 10 allows a character to wear Steel Full Plate AC 10 and use a Steel Tower Shield AC 5 without penalty.

Wearing armor above the character's Armor Training Level, or using a shield above half of Armor Training Level, causes a penalty to all physical actions and cancels-out the Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.
