# Animals (WIS)

This skill is used for all acts of taming, herding, training, and riding animals.

Charge Through: The character can attempt to do a cavalry charge through the enemy formation in order to break through to the other side and start attacking them from the back. The character must make a successful melee attack against one enemy in each row, then make an Animals check with a Difficulty of 15 + (number of enemies charged through). Any missed attack stops the charge.

Centaurs can use the Charge Through ability naturally.
