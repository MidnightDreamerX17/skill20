# Music (CHA)

Magic Song: Magic Songs always last for one minute (6 combat rounds), unless otherwise noted for the song type. The number of songs per day is equal to half their Music Level. For example, a Music Level of 10 allows five songs per day. The bonus given by a Magic Song is equal to half their Music Level. The song type determines what the bonus is applied to:

- Song of Aesthetic: Calm down crowds
- Song of Battle: All attack accuracy rolls
- Song of Depth: Caster level
- Song of Harmony: This song type does not have a normal duration. It reduces Music Level x 10 minutes from resting time. This song type can only be used immediately before resting.
- Song of Luck: All saving throws
- Song of Rhythm: Concentration checks
- Song of Themes: One attribute, chosen at the time of singing
