# Cleric Power (WIS)

The Cleric Power skill is intended to be used in combination with the Cleric Potential skill. There may be special situations that may allow usage of Cleric Memorization Slots and Cleric Spell Energies in other ways.

Cleric Spells Memorized: Always 2 higher than the number of spell energies for each circle.

Bonus Slots: Characters get one bonus spell energy for spell circles depending on their Wisdom modifier. For example, a character with a Wisdom of 18 will get a bonus spell energy for the 0th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd spell circles.
