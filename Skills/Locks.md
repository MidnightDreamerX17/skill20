# Locks (DEX)

This skill can be used to unlock all kinds of devices that would normally require a key or combination. Proper tools are also needed. For key-locks, Thieves' Tools or Rogue's Tools are required. For combination locks and safes, a method of sensing tiny vibrations in the lock is required.
