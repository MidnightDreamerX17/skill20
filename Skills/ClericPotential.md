# Cleric Magic (WIS)

Cleric Magic draws from the power of the gods, focusing it into a form that fits the typical actions and blessings of the gods. Even those who do not worship the gods must still acknowledge their existence, power, and immortality in order to use cleric magic.

Detect Undead: Characters of any alignment, including non-aligned, are entitled to a skill check to sense the presence of undead.

Stun Undead: Characters of any alignment, including non-aligned, may attempt to Stun Undead. They make a Cleric Magic check, with the difficulty equal to the undead's highest level + 10. On a success, the undead are stunned for a full round.

Destroy Undead: Characters of any Good alignment may attempt to Destroy Undead. They make a Cleric Magic check, with the difficulty equal to the undead's highest level + 20. On a success, the undead take an amount of damage per round equal to the Cleric Magic level, for as long as the character concentrates on destroying them. If the character gets a natural 20, then the undead are instantly disintegrated.

Turn Undead: Characters of any Good or Neutral alignment may attempt to Turn Undead. They make a Cleric Magic check, with the difficulty equal to the undead's highest level + 10. On a success, the undead must all turn around, exposing their backs to the party, and are stuck like that until the character stops concentrating on turning. If the character gets a natural 20, then the character may choose for the undead to run away immediately and jump into water or a pit.

Rebuke Undead: Characters of Neutral or Evil alignment may attempt to Rebuke Undead. They make a Cleric Magic check, with the difficulty equal to the undead's highest level + 10. On a success, the undead are unable to attack the party for as long as the character continues to concentrate on rebuking. If the character gets a natural 20, then the undead will also not report anything they see to their masters, but instead, may share information they know about their masters with the party.

Control Undead: Characters of Evil alignment may attempt to Control Undead. They make a Cleric Magic check, with the difficulty equal to the undead's highest level + 20. On a success, the undead serve the character for as long as they continue to concentrate on controlling. If the character gets a natural 20, then the range of control extends to anywhere within visual range, although it still requires concentration.
