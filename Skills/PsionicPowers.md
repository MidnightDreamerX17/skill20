# Psionic Powers (INT)

Psionic Powers use thought and mental energy to cause material effects. Although a very different kind of energy compared to magic, they are not opposed, so some people wield both psionics and magic at the same time.

At each level including the first, the character learns two psionic powers. The powers may be of a circle equal to or less than the character's maximum possible psionic power circle, according to the following table:

- Level 1: 1st-circle powers
- Level 3: 2nd-circle powers
- Level 5: 3rd-circle powers
- Level 7: 4th-circle powers
- Level 9: 5th-circle powers
- Level 11: 6th-circle powers
- Level 13: 7th-circle powers
- Level 15: 8th-circle powers
- Level 17: 9th-circle powers
- Level 19: 10th-circle powers
- Level 21: 11th-circle powers
- Level 23: 12th-circle powers
- Level 25: 13th-circle powers
- Level 27: 14th-circle powers
- Level 29: 15th-circle powers
- Level 31: 16th-circle powers
- Level 33: 17th-circle powers
- Level 35: 18th-circle powers
- Level 37: 19th-circle powers
- Level 39: 20th-circle powers

Bonus Psionic Powers: The character gets a number of additional 0th-circle and 1st-circle psionic powers known equal to their Intelligence bonus. For example, a character with an Intelligence score of 16 will start with 3 additional 0th-circle powers and 3 additional 1st-circle powers.
