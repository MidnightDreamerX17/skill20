# Animals (WIS)

This skill is used for all acts of taming, herding, training, and riding animals.

Charge Attack (map combat): The character can attempt to do a cavalry charge while moving past the target. In addition to the melee attack, the character must also make an Animals check with a difficulty of 10 + (target's experience level). If successful, then the melee attack hits for double damage. On a failure, the melee attack misses.

Charge Through (non-map combat): The character can attempt to do a cavalry charge through the enemy formation in order to break through to the other side and start attacking them from the back. The character must make a successful melee attack against one enemy in each row, then make an Animals check with a Difficulty of 15 + (number of enemies charged through). Any missed attack stops the charge.

Centaurs and Minotaurs can use the Charge Attack or Charge Through ability without a mount.
