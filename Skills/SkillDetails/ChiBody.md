**Iron Body:** This ability requires that the character is not wearing any armor, helmet, shield, or any other gear that has Armor Weight. It therefore cannot be used during the same combat round as *Armor Channelling*. The character's Armor Class is improved by an amount equal to their Chi Body Level. It also grants magic armor equivalency, to help save clothing and other carried items against various effects, as follows:

| Iron Body Level | Unarmored Magic Armor Equivalency |
| ---             | ---                               |
| 1 | Magic
| 4 | Magic +1
| 8 | Magic +2
| 12 | Magic +3
| 16 | Magic +4
| 20 | Magic +5
| 24 | Magic +6
| 28 | Magic +7
| 32 | Magic +8
| 36 | Magic +9
| 40 | Magic +10

**Hagane Yoroi Ha:** If the character also has the Chi Mysticism skill, then they can spend two Chi Power Points to cut the damage of a physical attack in half.

**Mahou Seki Ha:** If the character also has the Chi Mysticism skill, then they can spend two Chi Power Points to cut the damage of a spell, power, breath, psionic power, eye beam, etc. in half.

Chi Body Level 10: **Dasshutsu Ken:** If an enemy misses an attack against you by 10 or more, then you get a free five-foot movement.

Chi Body Level 20: **Hades:** Every time you are hit by an attack, you gain +2 AC for the rest of the combat round. The effect of *Hades* can accumulate multiple times, for example getting hit twice gives +4 AC, but only within the same combat round.
