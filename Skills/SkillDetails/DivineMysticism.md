# Divine Mysticism (WIS)

Divine Mysticism grants inherent knowledge of Cleric spells, without needing to worship any gods. Instead, it shapes magical power from one's own connection to divine energy and to various planes. As a result, Divine Mysticism is a favored skill by those who either have no access to gods, or who intentionally want to use divine power without the gods. Otherwise, those who already have the Cleric Potential (WIS) skill may see Divine Mysticism as a way to have more spells memorized at a time.

**Inherent Domain:** Each character must choose a different path of Divine Mysticism to bind themselves to. They choose one Domain that becomes permanently linked to their experience with the Divine Mysticism skill. Spells of that domain are available as choices for *Inherent Divine Spells*.

**Inherent Divine Spells:** The first level of Divine Mysticism grants knowledge of five 0th-circle spells and three 1st-circle spells. The spells are chosen from the Cleric list as well as from the *Inherent Domain*. Further skill levels grant knowledge of additional spells according to the *Divine Mysticism Spells Known or Changed* table.

*Inherent Divine Spells* are considered to be always-memorized, even while sleeping or in a coma, and do not use up any Cleric Memorization Slots. However, the act of casting these spells still requires usage of Cleric Spell Energies from the Cleric Power (WIS) skill.

**Changing Inherent Spells:** At each 4th skill level, the character can change one of their inherent spells for a different one. The highest spell circle that can be changed is listed in the *Divine Mysticism Spells Known or Changed* table.
