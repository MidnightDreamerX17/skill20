# Space Evasion Training (WIS)

Space Evasion Training sets the maximum Spacecraft Size that can be piloted in combat without a penalty, before other modifiers are taken into account.

Trying to pilot a craft with Spacecraft Size above the character's Space Evasion Training Level causes a penalty to all maneuvers and cancels out the Wisdom bonus to Armor Class.

Intuitive Piloting: With the Space Evasion Training skill, the character's Intelligence and Wisdom modifiers are also added to Spacecraft Size capacity. For example, with an Intelligence of 14 and a Wisdom of 14, the character gains 4 additional Spacecraft Size capacity, if they have the Space Evasion Training skill.
