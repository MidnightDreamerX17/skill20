# True Faith (CHA) (Aligned)

**Aura of Faith:** For all saving throws, both for the character and for all allies, True Faith skill can be used in place of the normal check. The one making the saving throw chooses which is more favorable before rolling the save.

**Detect Evil:** True Faith skill can be used to detect evil by looking at the target for 10 seconds (1 combat round).

**Lay on Hands:** Once per day, the character may touch themself or one ally to restore a number of hit points equal to double the True Faith Level. As the True Faith Level increases, the number of times per day increases, and the laying of hands removes other ailments.
