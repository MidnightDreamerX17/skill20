# Organization (INT)

The character can efficiently organize a number of other characters and NPCs equal to their Organization Level. They can go above this limit at the cost of having a less-efficient organization with all kinds of problems and confusion. They can also delegate to others who have the Organization skill. Unfortunately, at least 90% of NPCs do not even have the Organization skill, yet they continue to act like they know what they are doing and like they somehow do not need to learn anything about how to organize people.
