# Music (CHA)

The Music skill is used in combination with a Perform (CHA) skill. The effectiveness of the Music skill is capped by Perform (CHA) level.

**Magic Song:** Magic Songs always last for one minute (6 combat rounds), unless otherwise noted for the song type. The number of songs per day is equal to half their effective Music Level, with at least one song per day at Music Level 1. For example, an effective Music Level of 10 allows five songs per day. The bonus given by a Magic Song is equal to half their effective Music Level, with at least a bonus of +1 at Music Level 1. The song type determines what the bonus is applied to:

- Song of Aesthetic: The bonus is applied to checks to calm down crowds.
- Song of Battle: The bonus is applied to all attack accuracy rolls.
- Song of Depth: The bonus is applied to caster level.
- Song of Harmony: This song type does not have a normal duration. It reduces Music Level x 10 minutes from resting time. This song type can only be used immediately before resting.
- Song of Loudness: The bonus is applied to all sonic damage output, such as casting the *Sound Burst* spell or using a weapon that has a sonic damage component.
- Song of Lullaby: Each round of the song's duration, all enemies must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep. The difficulty of the save is equal to 5 + effective Music level. The save seems easy to make, except that since a check is required every single round that the song is playing, it becomes quite difficult to save against over time.
- Song of Luck: The bonus is applied to all saving throws.
- Song of Psyche: The bonus is applied to manifester level.
- Song of Rhythm: The bonus is applied to concentration checks (if using the slow spellcasting & slow manifestation rules).
- Song of Sprites: A creature is summoned for the duration of the song. It acts on the round that it was summoned on. Its experience level is equal to half of the effective Music level.
- Song of Themes: The bonus is applied to all d20 rolls involving one attribute. The attribute is chosen at the time of singing.
- Song of Toxicity: This song does not apply a bonus. Instead, it applies a penalty to enemies for saving throws against poison, disease, paralysis, polymorph, and death.

At Music (CHA) skill level 1, all songs are known. Perhaps the knowledge of the songs is encompassed within the first 100 experience points spent on the skill.
