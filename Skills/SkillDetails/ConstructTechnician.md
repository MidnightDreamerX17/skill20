# Construct Technician (INT)

You have experience in assembling, repairing, and upgrading constructs. A Construct Technician is able to assist a construct (such as a Law-Mech or War-Mech) with maintenance, software and hardware issues.  This includes speeding up recovery time, performing repairs on a construct that has fallen to zero or fewer hit points, resetting or altering programming, and performing hardware upgrades or exchanges.  A construct's maintenance time is shortened per day with a successful Construct Technician (INT) check by the amount shown below in the *Basic Upgrades* table. Damage to a construct can be repaired each day according to the repair numbers, and this number is also the bonus granted each day to any technician checks to reboot a dead construct.  Constructs have certain core upgrades that can be done on their hardware in any chassis.

It is illegal for most Construct Technicians to work on Loyalist Law-Mechs. They are not approved by the Law-Mech Master, as standard operations are performed strictly by the hierarchy of Law-Mechs, according to the patterns and orders that it has dictated. So, a typical Construct Technician instead deals with Rogue Law-Mechs, or War-Mechs.

## Basic Upgrades

| Skill Lvl | Maint. per Day | Repair Bonus | Upgrades |
| ---       | ---            | ---          | ---      |
| 1 | -30 minutes | +1 | New coat of paint: removes any rust and allows a custom paint job
| 2 | -45 minutes | +1 | Neon lights: attach lights of various types, easily powered by the construct's soul
| 3 | -60 minutes | +2 | Zoom vision: gives Telescoping Eyes 10X, +5 to visually-spot distant objects
| 4 | -75 minutes | +2 | Exterior Plating replacement: change exterior shape, allowing a 10% size reduction and/or a +2 bonus to evade visual pattern recognition
| 5 | -90 minutes | +3 | Macro vision: gives Analyzing Eyes 10X, +5 to visually-spot secret doors and traps
| 6 | -105 minutes | +3 | Hydraulic Legs: gives a bonus of +4 to feats of jumping
| 7 | -120 minutes | +4 | Undercoating: gives a bonus of +5 to saves against fire, cold and acid, lasts 12 months
| 8 | -135 minutes | +4 | Subwoofer: gives an ability that causes sonic damage within a 10-foot radius for 1d4 + Strength modifier damage, Constitution save for half
| 9 | -150 minutes | +5 | Active Magnetic Shielding: gives immunity to one instance of electric / lightning damage, then must be reset with a full-round action
| 11 | -180 minutes | +6 | Probability Unit: do not remain surprised for more than one round
| 13 | -210 minutes | +7 | Wireless Connection: a Law-Mech that has lost its connection to the Lawful Neutral Plane can be reconnected, if a Rogue, this allows it to communicate with Loyalist Law-Mechs again
| 15 | -240 minutes | +8 | Memory Upgrade: additional talking or mental action per round
| 17 | -270 minutes | +9 | Solid State Drive: no longer requires as much boot time, +20 to initiative
| 19 | -300 minutes | +10 | Graphics Processor: gain faster response times to visual inputs, +5 to AC
| 20 | -330 minutes | +11 | Dual Core: can operate original body and a modular body at the same time

Upgrades have a cost equal to 500 x Upgrade Level. The Upgrade Level is equal to the minimum Construct Technician (INT) level required for the upgrade.

All upgrades have a limited lifetime.  They require continuous maintenance to remain operational, otherwise the augmentations default to the base behaviour. A given upgrade will last 1 week per Construct Technician (INT) level. A technician must make a new skill check on a given construct after this period with a threshold of 10 + construct experience level + (number of upgrades * 2) to maintain that construct. 

## Modular Bodies

A construct technician may also build modular bodies into which a construct's consciousness may be transferred.

Swapping components requires 1 hour per unit of the component. If the technician desires to go faster, for every 10% faster there is a 5% cumulative chance of either the original component or new component having a failure, max 50% faster. A construct specialist shop (large room full of heavy specialized tools) can reduce times by 20% if they are at the same tech level, 10% at a close level, 5% at a related level.

A power source must be included in the units of each mech to complete the build.

**Tremor** - Tremor weapons have an option to strike the ground and create a small earthquake. All creatures within the first map range increment must make a Dexterity saving throw, with the difficulty equal to 10 + the user's experience level. Creatures who fail their Dexterity save will fall prone. All creatures in the second map range increment make the save at +5, and all creatures in the third map range increment make the save at +10. The user gains a bonus of +10 to save against its own Tremor.
