# Survival (WIS)

This skill is used for all outdoors survival tactics, such as firebuilding, setting up shelters, hunting, and the like.

Foraging: The character can spend 8 hours per day to automatically provide enough food and shelter (within reason for the type of environment) for a number of characters equal to their Survival Level. However, they must also be able to roam through a number of square miles equal to their Survival Level to do this.
