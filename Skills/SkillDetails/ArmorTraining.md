# Armor Training (CON)

Armor Training sets the maximum amount of Armor Weight that can be borne without penalty, before magic modifiers and other modifiers are taken into account.

Having Armor Weight above the character's Armor Training Level causes a penalty to all physical actions and cancels-out the Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.

Heavy Lifting: With the Armor Training skill, the character's Strength and Constitution modifiers are also added to Armor Weight capacity. For example, with a Strength of 14 and a Constitution of 14, the character gains 4 additional Armor Weight capacity, if they have the Armor Training skill.
