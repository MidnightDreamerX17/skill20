# Illusionist Potential (INT)

Illusionist Magic derives from the inherent magical power that exists in all sentient beings, as well as the primordial magical planes where beliefs, dreams, and imaginations reside. It requires a great amount of practice and refinement.

The Illusionist Potential skill is intended be used in combination with the Illusionist Power (INT) skill. It has some use by itself for reading illusionist scrolls, and in a low-magic world, that may be all that this skill does.

- Level 1: 1st-circle spells

Read Illusionist Scroll: Illusionist Potential is added as a bonus to rolls to use the power of illusionist scrolls, as well as to meld these scrolls into a spellbook.

Illusionist Spellbook: Each level of Illusionist Potential allows the character to get one free spell in their spellbook. The spell must be of a Spell Circle that is allowed by their new Illusionist Potential Level.

How Illusionist Magic Works: The Illusionist taps into the power of their own dreams and beliefs, and also draws power from primordial magical planes that are uninhabitable. They are further helped by the ambient magical energy that is present in all things that are capable of imagination and dreaming. Illusionist magic has real power and does real damage, but at the same time, is more vulnerable to being cancelled by enemies with strong wills. Illusionist spells only do damage if their spell descriptions specify damage, although their superficial traits can be modified freely by the Illusionist. Illusionist summons only have the capabilities specified in their spell descriptions, although their superficial traits can be modified freely by the Illusionist.

Grandiose Show: If other people voluntarily offer their emotions and dreams to the Illusionist, then the magic becomes more powerful. The caster level of the spell increases according to the number of willing audience members who have line of sight to the caster:

- 5: +1
- 10: +2
- 20: +3
- 40: +4
- 80: +5
- and so on...

Disbelieving Illusions: If other people collectively decide to resist the Illusionist's magic, then the magic becomes weaker. The caster level of the spell decreases according to the number of disbelievers who have line of sight to the caster:

- 5: -1
- 10: -2
- 20: -3
- 40: -4
- 80: -5
- and so on...

If the combined results of Grandiose Show and Disbelieving Illusions cause caster level to go to zero or less, then the spell does not function and is wasted. An illusionist who can make something happen in the midst of the most skeptical of crowds is truly powerful.
