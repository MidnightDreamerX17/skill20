- 2 Potions of Cure Moderate Wounds into 1 Potion of Cure Serious Wounds

Alchemy Level 40: Philosopher's Stone: The Alchemist knows exactly and unambiguously how to create a stone that can be used as a catalyst for transforming any mundane material into another mundane material.

Alchemy Level 50: Lead to Gold: The Alchemist knows exactly and unambiguously how to turn lead to gold. This requires an expensive and large enrichment facility as well as special purified heavy metals. The process is so inefficient that it is impossible to make a profit. What is most useful about the Lead-to-Gold process is that it can be used to create other unnatural metals. The unnatural metals are useful to Magisteam-level civilizations.

Alchemy Level 60: Eternal Youth: The Alchemist knows exactly and unambiguously how to make a potion that grants eternal youth. This also prevents the onset of age-related diseases, but does not cure existing ones. Such a potion requires exotic ingredients, such as plants from other planes, monster body parts of very rare monsters, dragon egg yolk, and the like.
