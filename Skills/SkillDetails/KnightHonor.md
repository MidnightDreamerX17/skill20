# Knight Honor (CHA) (Aligned)

Knight Honor requires a Lawful alignment.

The Knight Honor skill does not require that the character is legally a knight, but it does require the character to believe that honorable knights are a high ideal to live up to. If a character ever ceases to believe that an honorable knight is the best thing to be, then their effective Knight Honor skill level is capped at 0.

**Strength of Honor:** This ability can be used (Knight Honor / 3) times per day, for a minimum of once per day. The character can invoke their *Strength of Honor* to gain a bonus of +4 to Strength. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + Charisma modifier. At Knight Honor Level 6, the bonus is changed to +6.

**Knightly Courage:** The character's Charisma modifier is added to all saving throws against fear, panic, confusion, stunning, dizziness, and being shaken.

**Heroic Initiative:** Knight Honor skill level is added to the character's initiative.

Knight Honor Level 3: **Fight to the Death:** The character can continue to do move and attack actions while down to negative 10 hit points. If their Constitution is 9 or lower, then this ability still applies, meaning that the character could potentially be fighting while dead.

Knight Honor Level 4: **Honorable Will:** The character's Charisma modifier is added to all saving throws against mind-altering effects such as sleep, charm, geas, quest, and the like.

Knight Honor Level 9: **Aura of Courage:** The character becomes immune to fear. All allies within line-of-sight of the character gain a bonus of +4 to save against fear. This ability is always active while the character is conscious and able to fight, but ineffective otherwise.

Knight Honor Level 10: **Crown of Knighthood:** The character's Charisma modifier is added to all saving throws. The character also gains a bonus of +4 to save against mind-altering effects such as sleep, charm, geas, quest, and the like. The character gains an inherent *Greater Heroism* spell that can be cast once per day.

Knight Honor Level 11: **Rallying Cry:** Three times per day, the character can shout a *Rallying Cry* for 1 second (usually compatible with all other actions). This shout causes all allies who can hear it to gain a bonus of +1 to attack accuracy and +5 feet to their movement.

Knight Honor Level 12: **Inspire Courage:** Twice per day, the character can enter a state of chanting in order to *Inspire Courage*. This chanting uses up all actions except movement while it is active. All allies who can hear the chanting gain a bonus of +2 to saving throws against fear, and +2 to attack accuracy and damage. At Knight Honor Level 5, the bonus is changed to +3 and the chanting can be started three times per day. At Knight Honor Level 8, the bonus is changed to +4 and the chanting can be started four times per day.

Knight Honor Level 14: **Inspire Greatness:** The character gains an inherent *Heroism* spell that can be cast once per day. This usage of *Heroism* also grants 2d10 divine shield hit points.

Knight Honor Level 16: **Wisdom of Knightly Virtues:** The character gains an inherent *Augury* spell that can be cast once per day. Instead of requesting an augury from a god, this usage of spell connects to the collective wisdom of all honorable knights of the past.

Knight Honor Level 19: **Final Stand:** Once per day, the character can spend 1 second to announce the *Final Stand*. This is usually compatible with all other actions in the round. All allies who can hear the character gain 2d10 divine shield hit points.

Knight Honor Level 20: **Knighthood's Flower:** The character becomes immune to mind-altering effects unless they are purely beneficial. The character also gains an inherent *Foresight* spell that can be cast once per day on themself.
