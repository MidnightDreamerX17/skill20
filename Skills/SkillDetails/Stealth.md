# Stealth (DEX)

Back Attack: The character must be behind the enemy somehow - whether through the Stealth skill's infiltration ability, by ambush, by tactical combat movement, or by other means. The character gains a bonus of +5 to attack accuracy and physical damage against the backs of enemies.

Infiltration (non-map combat): The character can spend a full action to both hide and move silently in the middle of combat. If successful on both checks, then they advance one row into the enemy rows.

Stealth Level 20: Jump Into Shadow: If the character successfully hides, then they become invisible as per the spell *Invisibility* until they move out of shadows.

Stealth Level 30: Greater Jump Into Shadow: If the character successfully hides, then they become invisible as per the spell *Greater Invisibility* until they move out of shadows.

Stealth Level 40: Ultimate Jump Into Shadow: If the character successfully hides, then they shift into their own personal shadow plane until they do a non-movement action.

First Attack: The target must not be in active combat awareness. If the target can sense the character, then it must not be suspicious of him/her.
