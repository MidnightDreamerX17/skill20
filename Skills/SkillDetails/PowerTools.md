# Power Tools (INT)

The Power Tools skill is a prerequisite for crafting and utilizing a variety of power tools.

The open market value of a power tool is usually double the cost of its materials.

The time scale for Power Tools crafting checks is always one hour per roll. No more than 2 industrial objects or 1 military object can be crafted per hour.
