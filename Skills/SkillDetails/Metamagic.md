# Metamagic (INT)

The Metamagic skill allows the character to modify spells that they are able to memorize, although at the cost of increasing the spell's circle. This causes the spell to require a higher circle of memorization slot, and expend a higher circle of spell energy.

If the caster is specialized in a domain or school, then specialized 0th-circle spells can still be memorized with a +1 circle metamagic as 0th-circle.

If the caster is specialized in both a domain and a school, then double-specialized 1st-circle spells can be memorized with a +1 circle metamagic as 0th-circle. Double-specialized 0th-circle spells can be memorized with a +2 circle metamagic as 0th-circle.
