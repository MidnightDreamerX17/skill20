# Warlock Pacts (CHA)

The Warlock Pacts skill allows the character to make deals with otherworldly patrons in exchange for magical power. At each Warlock Pact Level, the character learns a new pact. Each pact can do one of the following:

- Allow one spell to be memorized into a memorization slot of a different magic type, e.g. memorizing *Cure Light Wounds* into a 1st-circle Wizard memorization slot. This spell also no longer requires a spellbook, prayer, or permission from any higher powers.
- Allow one spell to be memorized into a lower-circle slot of the same magic type, e.g. memorizing Magic Missile into a 0th-circle Wizard memorization slot. This spell also no longer requires a spellbook, prayer, or permission from any higher powers.

Many patrons give other permanent gifts and mutations as well, although these always have severe downsides.
