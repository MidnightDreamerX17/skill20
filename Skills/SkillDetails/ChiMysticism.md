Chi Mysticism Level 19: **ATTSUUTEN-KEN**: The character gains greatly improved control over their instant-death strikes from *Ansatsuken* once per week. The character must declare usage of this ability after a successful attack. The target comes under the effect of the quivering palm for three rounds. During this time, the character may cause the target to die instantly by speaking a special key word.

Once the character touches the target, they choose one of the following effects: charm as per the *Charm Monster* spell, cureall as a combination of *Heal*, *Regeneration*, and *Greater Restoration* spells, quest as per the *Quest* spell, and paralysis as per the *Hold Monster* spell.

Chi Mysticism Level 23: **CHAKRA**: The character may use two Chi Power Points in order to remove all poisons, diseases, blindness, deafness, and paralysis from the whole party. Afflictions that would require *Regeneration* type magic to be healed, such as missing limbs, cannot be healed by *Chakra*.

Chi Mysticism Level 25: **RAGE:** Upon being raised from the dead, resurrected, and similar effects, the character regains all Chi Power Points and gains 10 additional temporary Chi Power Points that only last for 1 minute.

The character can switch between normal mode and stand projection mode at will. The stand can be projected to anywhere within visual range, including behind an enemy group.
