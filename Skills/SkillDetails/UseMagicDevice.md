# Use Magic Device (CHA)

The character can attempt to use magic items and equipment that normally have racial, alignment, or other such restrictions. The character must make a Use Magic Device check with the difficulty being equal to the equipment's level + 10. If the character fails, then the magic item is dropped on the ground, and another attempt cannot be made for a week.
