A metal washing bucket appears above the target's head. If the target attempts to move away the bucket will tip. The sudsy water contained within splashes causing temporary blindness one round, a thorough soaking of clothes and a ruined hair style.

A successful Intelligence save will cause the bucket, water, and suds to condense into harmless magical goo on contact with the one who made the save.
