*Magic Clock* creates a purely-magical floating object that gives the number of milliseconds that have passed since the caster's birth or current incarnation. It requires a magic potential skill in order to read. For example, a *Magic Clock* that was created using Druid spell energy will require the Druid Potential (WIS) skill in order to read.

Due to the reading requirement, one can imagine that the way the clock appears to work is wildly different, depending on the spell energy used to create it.

For example:

- Cleric Example 1 - The clock is a tapestry of important events in the deity's history. The amount of the tapestry that is complete, as well as the scenes portrayed, indicate the time. It is possible that the figures on the tapestry could be constantly moving around as well.
- Cleric Example 2 - The clock is a painting of one of the saints of the deity, exactly as that saint appeared in some specific point in time.
- Druid Example 1 - The clock is a cross-section slice of a tree, with insects and other creatures moving in and out of it. It expands or contracts its radius according to the time as well.
- Druid Example 2 - The clock is a small box of plants and insects, showing species that only existed at specific periods of history.
- Illusionist Example 1 - The clock is a picture flip-book of magic tricks, constantly flipping itself and showing tricks of varying complexity.
- Illusionist Example 2 - The clock is an illusion of someone escaping from a water trap.
- Wizard Example 1 - The clock is a tablet with magical runes. To someone without Wizard Potential (INT) skill, the runes seem to randomly shift and change colors. In fact, they have a complex relationship, and consist of at least 10 different magical languages.
- Wizard Example 2 - The clock is diagram showing a star surrounded by planets, with energy flows of various colors shooting between the objects.
