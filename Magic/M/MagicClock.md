*Magic Clock* creates a purely-magical floating object that gives the number of milliseconds that have passed since the caster's birth or current incarnation. It requires a magic potential skill in order to read. For example, a *Magic Clock* that was created using Druid spell energy will require the Druid Potential (WIS) skill in order to read.

Due to the reading requirement, one can imagine that the way the clock appears to work is wildly different, depending on the spell energy used to create it.

For example:

- Cleric - The clock is a tapestry of important events in the deity's history. The amount of the tapestry that is complete, as well as the scenes portrayed, indicate the time. It is possible that the figures on the tapestry could be constantly moving around as well.
- Druid - The clock is a cross-section slice of a tree, with insects and other creatures moving in and out of it. It expands or contracts its radius according to the time as well.
- Illusionist - The clock is a picture flip-book of magic tricks, constantly flipping itself and showing tricks of varying complexity.
- Wizard - The clock is a tablet with magical runes. To someone without Wizard Potential (INT) skill, the runes seem to randomly shift and change colors. In fact, they have a complex relationship, and consist of at least 10 different magical languages.
