You alter an item’s aura so that it registers to *Detect Spells* (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.

If the object bearing magic aura has *Identify* cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object’s actual qualities if the *Identify* caster succeeds on a Wisdom save. Otherwise, the *Identify* caster believes the aura.

If the targeted item’s own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it was crafted by someone 20 experience levels higher, for instance), *Magic Aura* doesn’t work.
