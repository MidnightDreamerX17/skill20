You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spellâ€™s range.

Attempting to fling it as fast as possible will make it act as a ranged throwing weapon for 1d4 damage, then ends the spell.
