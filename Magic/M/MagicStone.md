You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If thrown by hand, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 magic bonus. Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the spell's magic bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.
