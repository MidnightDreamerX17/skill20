## The Origin of Magic

Magic is a specific expression of elemental power and of life energy. In this way, it is related to psionics. However, magic tightly binds the specific form of a spell to the inner power that is used up for that spell. Indeed, simply reading and understanding magical writing is quite the endeavor in itself.

## Memorization Slots and Spell Energies

Memorization slots and spell energies are separate for each type of magic. For example, Cleric spells cannot be memorized into Wizard memorization slots, nor can Cleric spells use Wizard spell energies for spellcasting. A character with all four magic skill types would have quite a bit of bookkeeping to do.

The number of memorization slots are always 2 higher than the number of spell energies for each circle. For example, if a character has the Wizard Potential (INT) and Wizard Power (INT) skills, and the *Spell Energies Per Day* table says that the character has 2 wizard spell energies of the 0th circle, then they have 4 wizard memorization slots for the 0th circle.

After eight hours of rest, all spell energies are regained, and the memorization slots can be changed once. It must be noted that *being woken up in the middle of the night* cancels the refreshment of spell energies. The Sorcery (CHA) skill grants the possibility of further changes to memorized spells.

Cleric and Druid spells must be memorized by praying to gods, nature, planes, elements, and the like. It is possible for the gods to disallow characters from memorizing certain spells into their Cleric and Druid memorization slots.

Wizard and Illusionist spells must be memorized by reading from the spellcaster's personal spellbook, or from a universal *book of one spell*.

## Spellcasting

The spellcaster chooses one of their memorized spells. Spellcasting is mutually exclusive with all other actions. The spellcasting takes a full round, and takes effect immediately before the spellcaster's next turn. Once the spellcasting is finished, the spellcaster uses up a spell energy corresponding to the circle of the spell. For example, casting Magic Missile will use up a 1st-circle spell energy.

Any amount of damage during the spellcasting will force a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the spellcaster. On a success, the spell is not interrupted. On a failure, the spell is interrupted, but the spell energy is not expended.

## Converting Spells to Map-less Combat

Area of effect conversion for map-less combat:

- Touch - One ally, or one enemy in the front row. No touch attack roll is required.
- Ranged Touch - One ally, or one enemy. No ranged touch attack roll is required.
- Ray - one enemy in the front row and one enemy in the back row
- Cone - the front row of enemies
- Small area of effect - one row of enemies
- Large area of effect - all enemies

## Spellcasting Items

The common market value per use of an item is as follows:

| Spell Circle | Price per use | Crafting Cost | Crafting threshold |
| ---          | ---           | ---           | ---      |
| 0th          | 50            | 25            | 5, two may be crafted per day

**Book of One Spell** - Books of One Spell can only be used after eight hours of rest - the same conditions as for reading one's own personal spellbook. The user must make a skill check to read the book with a difficulty of 12 + (Spell Circle * 2). If successful, then the user has memorized the spell in the book. If the skill check fails, then the user cannot attempt to memorize the spell from the Book of One Spell for the rest of the day. Books of One Spell have an unlimited number of uses, so their cost is equal to the cost of 20 uses.

**Paper** - The reader must make a skill check to read the paper with a difficulty of 12 + (Spell Circle * 2). The caster level is equal to the relevant skill level of the reader. Once the spell is cast, the paper is vaporized. If the skill check fails or if concentration is broken, the paper is preserved.

**Potions** - The user can drink one potion in order to apply the spell's effect to themself. A potion can be poured into the mouth of an unconscious or dead person. Finally, potions can be used as ranged throwing weapons to apply their effect to one target. The caster level of a potion is the minimum required to be able to cast its spell normally. For example, a *Potion of Cure Moderate Wounds* will have a caster level of 3. Potions are always single-target, so for example, throwing a *Potion of Fireball* at someone would be inefficient compared to just casting it, although allowed.

**Spell Focus** *(Rod / Staff / Wand)* - The user must have the magic potential skill that corresponds to the spell focus, but a skill level of 1 is sufficient to utilize the full power. The caster level of the spell effect is equal to the caster level of the one who crafted the spell focus. If the user has the spell memorized, then they can spend spell energies to add charges to the spell focus at a rate of one per day. The crafting cost for one use of the spell must also be paid to add the charge. Once all charges in the spell focus are used up, the spell focus is vaporized.

**Scroll** - The reader must make a skill check to read the scroll with a difficulty of 12 + (Spell Circle * 2). The caster level is the minimum required to be able to cast the spell normally, so for example, a Scroll of Identify has a caster level of 1. Once the spell is cast, the scroll is vaporized. If the skill check fails or if concentration is broken, the scroll is preserved. In addition to the effective caster level, scrolls have another key difference to papers. A Wizard Scroll can be inserted into a Wizard Spellbook, taking one hour and no skill check, in order to permanently become part of that spellbook. Likewise for Illusionist Scrolls and Illusionist Spellbooks.

## Crafting Spellcasting Items

The character must have the spell memorized during the entire crafting process.

First, the character must provide a certain amount of gold value in materials. This depends on the spell circle and the number of spell uses.

Second, the character must make one skill check per day, accumulating a total throughout multiple days, until the threshold difficulty is exceeded.

The skill used for crafting is as follows:

- **Book of One Spell** - Craft (Int) (Magic Writing)
- **Paper** - Craft (Int) (Magic Writing)
- **Potion** - Alchemy (Int)
- **Scroll** - Craft (Int) (Magic Writing)
- **Spell Focus** - Craft (Int) (Magic Focuses)

## Writing Spells Into Spellbooks

Generally, having the *Read Magic* spell active makes this endeavor possible. Otherwise, you will need to make a Wizard Potential or Illusionist Potential skill check, with the difficulty equal to 12 + (Spell Circle * 2) in order to be able to read the book or scroll.

It takes 1 day per writing attempt.

The difficulty to finish writing the spell is 12 + (Spell Circle * 2). On a failure, the day's work is wasted, but no items are destroyed.

If using a scroll, then on a success, the scroll is used up and disintegrates.

Spellbooks generally have 100 pages each, with each spell taking a number of pages equal to its Spell Circle. 0th-circle spells take a half-page each.
