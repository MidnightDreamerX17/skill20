This spell generates pure water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large — possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles.

**Note:** Conjuration spells can’t create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.
