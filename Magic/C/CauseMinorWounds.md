When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel negative energy that causes 1 point of damage +1 point per caster level. The target can apply spell resistance, and make a Wisdom saving throw to halve the damage.

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell heals them instead of causing any wounds.
