A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each successful melee attack within the duration discharges one *Chill Touch* in order to add 1d6 points of negative energy damage. The number of *Chill Touch* charges per casting is equal to caster level.

The creature hit by the *Chill Touch* effect also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw.

Undead creatures do not take negative energy damage, but they must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds, +1 round per caster level.
