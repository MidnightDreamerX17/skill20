When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1 point of damage +1 point per caster level.

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Wisdom save to take half damage.
