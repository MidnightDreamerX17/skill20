You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You must give the command in a language the subject understands. If the subject fails a Wisdom saving throw, and knows the language the command was given in, then its next action must be to comply with the command. At 10th caster level, the effect lasts for two actions. At 20th caster level, the effect lasts for three actions.

You may select from the following options.

**Approach** - On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn.

**Drop** - On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can’t pick up any dropped item until the spell ends.

**Fall** - On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for for the duration of the spell. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.

**Flee** - On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible. It may do nothing but move during its turn.

**Halt** - The subject stands in place. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.

If the subject can’t carry out your command, the spell automatically ends.
