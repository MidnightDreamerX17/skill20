- **Verbal Component:** Vox Existo Prodere Remitto
- **Arcane Focus:** A parchment rolled up into a small cone

You can make your voice (or any sound that you can normally make vocally) seem to issue from someplace else. You can speak in any language you know.

Anyone who hears the sound may make a Wisdom save. If successful, they hear magical glitches and distortions in the sound, thus recognizing it as an illusion.
