Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies.

You can strike an opponent with a melee attack, adding 1d6 fire damage +1 point per caster level.

Alternatively, you can hurl the flames with an increment of 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged throwing weapon attack. The flame as a projectile does 1d6 fire damage +1 point per caster level. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand.

Each successful attack you make, either melee or throwing, reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

This spell does not function underwater.
