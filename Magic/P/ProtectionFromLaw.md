This spell wards a creature from attacks by lawful creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saving throws. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by lawful creatures.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the protected creature (by a *Magic Jar* attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as *Dominate Person*). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the *Protection From Law* effect. If the *Protection from Law* effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the unarmed natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the protected creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the protected creature.
