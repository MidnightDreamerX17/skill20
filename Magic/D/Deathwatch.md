Using the foul sight granted by the powers of unlife, you can determine the condition of creatures near death within the spellâ€™s range. You instantly know whether each creature within the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct).

*Deathwatch* sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures to feign death.
