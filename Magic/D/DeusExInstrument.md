This spell transmutes one object of any sort into a desired musical instrument.  The substance of the object becomes an instrument of relatively the same volume, so a small object may be a small instrument, a medium a medium one, and at most a large object could be a large instrument, along the lines of a stand-up bass or piano.  The spell is maintained as long as the spellcaster concentrates on playing the instrument, after which it returns to the original object.
