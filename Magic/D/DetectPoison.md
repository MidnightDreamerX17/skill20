You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a difficulty 20 Wisdom check. A character with the Alchemy (INT) skill may try a difficulty 20 skill check check if the Wisdom check fails.

The magic sight can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
