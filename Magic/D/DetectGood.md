You can sense the presence of good. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

**1st Round:** Presence or absence of good.

**2nd Round:** Number of aligned auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent aligned aura present.

If you are of evil alignment, and the strongest good aura’s power is overwhelming (see below), and the experience level of the aura’s source is at least twice your character experience level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.

**3rd Round:** The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

**Aura Power:** An aligned aura’s power depends on the type of aligned creature or object that you’re detecting and its experience level or caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.

| Creature/Object | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming | Special |
| ---             | ---   | ---      | ---    | ---          | ---     |
| Aligned creature | 10 or lower | 11 - 25 | 26 - 50 | 51 or higher | Except for undead and outsiders, which have their own entries on the table
| Undead | 2 or lower | 3 - 8 | 9 - 20 | 21 or higher
| Aligned outsider | 1 or lower | 2 - 4 | 5 - 10 | 11 or higher
| Mortal with Cleric skills | 2 or lower | 3 - 8 | 9 - 20 | 21 or higher

**Lingering Aura:** An aligned aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If the detection spell is cast and the caster's eyes are directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

| Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura |
| Faint | 1d6 rounds
| Moderate | 1d6 minutes
| Strong | 1d6×10 minutes
| Overwhelming | 1d6 days

Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not inherently aligned, and as such this spell does not detect them. Unless they have a magical component caused by an aligned plane or an aligned spellcaster.

Each round, you can turn to look and detect in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
