This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.

If someone makes a successful Wisdom saving throw, then they see glitches of magic in the image, thus recognizing it as an illusion.
