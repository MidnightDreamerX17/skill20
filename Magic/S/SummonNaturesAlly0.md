This spell summons a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. This also means that creatures capable of gating are not allowed to be chosen by this spell. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.

The spell conjures a creature with no experience levels and no skills, examples of which are given in the *Examples of Level 0 Summonable Monsters* list. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.

**Examples of Level 0 Summonable Monsters:**

- Chick wearing an eggshell for pants
- Gerbil
- Goldfish (may only be summoned into an aquatic environment)
- Mouse

If the details of the desired monster type are not available in any book whatsoever, then the defaults are as follows:

It has an Armor Class of 10, 1 hit point, and a natural weapon dealing 1 point of damage. It has a bonus of +2 to some specific types of perception and athletics.
