The caster changes 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per caster level, into Level 2 divine sticksnakes.

Level 2 divine sticksnakes are as follows:

- HP: 2 dice
- AC: 14
- Attack: Either constriction or bite
- Constriction Attack: 1d4+1 impact damage per round
- Bite Attack: 1 puncture damage, plus chance of poison on hit. The chance of poison on hit is equal to 5% * caster level, so for example, casting this spell with a caster level of 11 will cause the resulting divine sticksnakes to have 55% chance to poison on bite.

The poison of a divine sticksnake requires a Constitution saving throw to negate, or else it causes 1 point of damage per round (10 seconds) for a whole hour.
