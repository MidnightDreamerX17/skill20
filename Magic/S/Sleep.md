A *Sleep* spell causes a magical slumber to come upon an amount of experience levels equal to 4 + caster level. Creatures with the fewest experience levels are affected first.

The maximum experience level that can be affected by this spell is 4. For example, if the spell targets 6 experience levels of creatures, then it still cannot affect a creature of experience level 5 or 6.

Among creatures with equal experience levels, those who are closest to the spellâ€™s point of origin are affected first. Experience levels that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).

Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
