This spell summons an illusory creature. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. This also means that creatures capable of gating are not allowed to be chosen by this spell. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.

The spell conjures a creature with no experience levels. It has no skills. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.

The creature's true appearance is a vague humanoid shape made of clouds.

Disbelief in a creature summoned by this spell will cause recognition that it is made of pure magic and to see its true appearance. But, disbelief will not stop the creature.

It has an Armor Class of 10, 1 hit point, and a natural weapon dealing 1 point of magical damage.
