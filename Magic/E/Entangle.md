This spell manipulates existing plant life in the area.

Grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area or those that enter the area, holding them fast and causing them to become entangled. The creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a Difficulty 20 Strength check or a Difficulty 20 Dexterity check. A creature that succeeds on a Dexterity save is not entangled but can still move at only half speed through the area. Each round on your turn, the plants once again attempt to entangle all creatures that have avoided or escaped entanglement.

**Note:** The effects of the spell may be altered somewhat, based on the nature of the entangling plants.
