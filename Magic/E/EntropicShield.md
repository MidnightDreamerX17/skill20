A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. You gain a bonus of +4 to armor class against such attacks. Other attacks that simply work at a distance, such as long pikes, are not affected.
