*Erase* removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove *Explosive Runes*, a *Glyph of Warding*, a *Sepia Snake Sigil*, or an *Arcane Mark*, but not *Illusory Script* or a *Symbol* spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against Difficulty 15 + magic writer's experience level. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase *Explosive Runes*, a *Glyph of Warding*, or a *Sepia Snake Sigil*, you accidentally activate that writing instead.
