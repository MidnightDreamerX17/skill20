This spell attempts to instantly ignite all ammunition within the area. Affected ammunition is up to an inch in diameter, or just over two and a half centimeters in diameter.

If affected ammunition is carried in an unarmored part of the body, then each magazine of such ammunition causes 1d4 damage to the carrier. Otherwise, affected magazines carried on armored parts of the body only do 1 point of damage to the carrier.
