A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has has a bonus of +4 to AC. Creatures farther away have a bonus of +10 to AC and to hide visually.

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a *Gust of Wind* spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A *Fireball*, *Flame Strike*, or similar area-of-effect fire spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spellâ€™s area. A *Wall of Fire* burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.
