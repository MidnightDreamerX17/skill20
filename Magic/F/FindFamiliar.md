You create a permanent Level 0 animal of small size or smaller. It recognizes you as its master, and will try to follow orders, but otherwise acts independently.

While it is within Medium range of you (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level), you can perform the following actions:

- Communicate with it telepathically
- Use its senses, shutting down your own senses. This takes a full round action.
- Cast a spell that has a range of touch/melee, or which adds an effect to unarmed/natural weapons. You choose to apply the effect to the familiar's touch rather than your own.
- Dismiss it into a pocket plane where it awaits your summons.

While your familiar is in its pocket plane, you can bring it back out to any location within Close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels) by using an action.

You can only have one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

The GM may require that the familiar is random, determined by a d20 roll.
