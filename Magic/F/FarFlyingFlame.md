*Far-Flying Flame* creates a bolt of flame that flies from the caster’s finger to strike any single target within range. The caster’s sight may be augmented with eyes of the eagle or other effects to improve his natural vision, but visions based on scrying or similar effects do not aid in targeting this spell.

*Far-Flying Flame* does 1d4 points of damage per caster level and has a chance of setting anything flammable it hits on fire. The bolt flies in a parabolic arc and, thus, can be seen coming from a distance, allowing the target time to get out of the way, hence a Dexterity save negates all damage. Also because of that parabolic arc, the bolt requires overhead clearance equal to 1/3 the distance the bolt travels, normally making it only useful outdoors.
