This spell allows the caster to put one creature into a cataleptic state that resembles death. The subject can hear, smell and taste, but cannot feel or see while in this spell, neither does it need to breathe, eat, or drink while under the spell’s influence. Any damage suffered while under this spell is halved, and the subject is immune to paralyzation, energy drain and mind-affecting effects. Poison only affects the subject if the poison’s effect lasts longer than the spell duration, and the subject is allowed the normal saving throw against it.
