A 3 foot diameter ring of guard amanita mushrooms appear. If any small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet, the mushrooms will begin shrieking "Murdering thieves!" The fungi are able to sense illusions as well as invisible and ethereal creatures.

If the intruder approaches to within 5 feet the fungi will emit a thick spore cloud equivalent to the *Darkness* spell.
