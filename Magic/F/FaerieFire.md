*Faerie Fire* targets all creatures and objects within the area of effect, even if the caster cannot see them.

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-circle or higher magical *darkness* effect functions normally), *Blur*, *Displacement*, *Invisibility*, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The *faerie fire* can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The *faerie fire* does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
