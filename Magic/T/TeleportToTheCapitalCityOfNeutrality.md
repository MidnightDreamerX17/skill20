This spell instantly transports you to the Capital City of Neutrality, in the center of the Plane of Neutrality. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

The specific destination is, itself, a neutral town square that seems to have been built solely to catch those who are affected by this spell. Peace is strictly enforced in that town square.

This spell has no reverse, so it is a one-way trip unless you have other magic or psionic powers.
