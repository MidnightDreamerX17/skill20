A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Dexterity save, or else slip on the grease and fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a Difficulty 10 Dexterity check. Failure means it canâ€™t move that round (and must then make a Dexterity save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it slips and falls.

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature can no longer grip the item with any amount of pressure or friction, consequently dropping it. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 bonus to get out of a grapple, to get out of ropes, and other such checks.
