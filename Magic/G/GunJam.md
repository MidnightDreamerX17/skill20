This spell creates a field of magical firearm-jamming energy. Trigger mechanisms in the area are completely stuck. Bullets in the area have their primers magically protected, so that they cannot be manually stricken or hammered. Electronic firing systems for gunpowder are also halted within the area.

Objects outside of the area function normally.
