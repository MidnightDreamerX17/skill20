Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the soundâ€™s basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your caster experience level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster experience level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

A successful Wisdom save against the spell allows the saver to recognize that the sound is illusory, but it does not make the sound stop.

Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a *Silent Image* spell.
