This spell creates a number of sparks equal to caster level. The sparks start out on the ground in front of the caster, then start travelling on the caster's next turn. Each spark passes harmlessly through the caster's allies and homes in on a target of the caster's choice, dealing 1d6 electric damage. Each spark requires a separate Dexterity saving throw to avoid. Each spark must perform its movement entirely along the ground that the caster was standing on, and connected objects and terrain features.

Targets who are within 10 feet of the caster have a penalty of -5 to the saving throw.
