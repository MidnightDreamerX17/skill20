This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature’s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a -2 penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1).

This spell doesn’t change the target’s speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.

Other magical properties of weapons and ammunition are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.

Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.
