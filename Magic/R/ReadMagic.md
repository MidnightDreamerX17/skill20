By means of read magic, you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects — books, scrolls, weapons, and the like — at an extremely fast speed. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of *Read Magic*. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a *Glyph of Warding* with a difficulty 13 magic potential skill check, a *Greater Glyph of Warding* with a difficulty 16 magic potential skill check, or any *Symbol* spell with a magic potential skill check (difficulty of 10 + spell circle).
