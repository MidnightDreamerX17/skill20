The spellcaster creates a blast of pure cold energy, which freezes an enemy in place upon contact, unless they succeed immediately on a Strength save against paralysis. A successful save results in 1d8 cold damage. The paralysis endures for 1d4+1 rounds. The victim is not killed by this, but simply held in place by ice, suffering 1d8 cold damage per round. Each round, the target or an ally can make a Strength check to break them free. Every 4 caster levels, the paralysis effect is increased by one round.
