When laying your hand upon a living creature, you create illusory blood, tissues, and organs that give temporary hit points for the duration. The number of temporary hit points is 1 point, +1 point per caster level.

If the target receives a true *Cure* or *Heal* spell, then the temporary hit points from *Holographic Cure* are also made true, up to the target's maximum hit points.
