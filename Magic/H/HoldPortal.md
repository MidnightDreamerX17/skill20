This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A *Knock* spell or a successful *Dispel Magic* spell can negate a *Hold Portal* spell.

For a portal affected by this spell, add 5 to the normal difficulty for forcing open the portal.
