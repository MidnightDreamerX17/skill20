The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.

A flying construct who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings nor intake any air in its propellers and jets, and will stall out and fall accordingly. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.
