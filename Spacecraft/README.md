# Spacecraft

## Rules

Space Combat rules for Skill20 are always map-less, because keeping track of three-dimensional space at distances of thousands of miles is rather challenging.

Armor Class receives a modifier equal to the pilot's Wisdom modifier. This represents the ability to turn and thrust craft in unexpected ways that throw off the targeting of pursuers.

If a spacecraft is landed, docked, or hovers sufficiently-close to someone on foot, then it can be attacked by those who are on foot. It gains a bonus of +5 to Armor Class against those on foot, due to armor plating and the like. This implies that it is possible for a foot combatant of experience level 5 or higher to fight duels with spacecraft that are tethered, and possibly win. This also implies that magic users could destroy large spacecraft if the craft would hold still for long enough.

Shield HP is restored after 1 hour of not being shot at. Some systems may also provide shield regeneration.

Spacecraft have the choice of taking a penalty of 10 to Armor Class in order to gain a bonus of +5 to accuracy.
