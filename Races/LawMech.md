Telescoping Eyes: Law-Mechs can spend a minute to calibrate their eyes to work like telescopes. This thusly allows them to see very distant objects.

Analyzing Eyes: Law-Mechs are constantly searching for secret doors and concealed doors at the same time as all their other actions.

Unnatural Life: Law-Mechs get their souls and life energy from the Law-Mech Plane. They gain a bonus of +5 against sleep and mind-altering effects, as well as a bonus of +5 against hit points drain, energy drain, level drain, attribute drain, and the like.

Resistant Coating: Law-Mechs gain a bonus of +2 to all saving throws against fire, cold, and acid.

Uncalculated Outcomes: When surprised, Law-Mechs remain that way for two rounds rather than one.

Fried Circuits: Law-Mechs are always stunned upon taking lightning damage.

Maintenance: Law-Mechs require roughly eight hours of maintenance every day, but unlike most mortals, these hours do not need to be contiguous. Without proper maintenance, they will eventually break down and die after 10 years. If they are properly maintained, then they can last forever.

Repair: Law-Mechs can be repaired as constructs for one hit point per day, with the difficulty being equal to 10 + the Law-Mech's own experience level. This is in addition to hit points regained by resting.

Reboot: Dead Law-Mechs can be resurrected by repairing them for 7 days straight. One check must be made each day. The difficulty is equal to 10 + the Law-Mech's Experience Level. Once a successful check is made for 7 days straight, the Law-Mech comes back to life with 1 hit point at the end of the 7th day.
