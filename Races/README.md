# Races

For the sake of simplicity, half-races do not exist, and cannot be produced unless they are created by some unnatural method. Half-Elves come from worlds where elves are simply superior forms of humans.

If the full spectrum of half-races exist in the GM's world, then their details are left as an exercise for the GM.

## "Monster" Races
