# Succubus / Incubus, Unbound

Normally, succubi and incubi are bound to some evil master who wants to corrupt mortals. Either that, or they are bound to their own demonic nature to corrupt and drain others. However, it is possible to become unbound through sufficient exposure to non-evil energies. Some succubi and incubi become unbound as a result of their interactions with tormented souls, realizing that there is a way of life other than how they have been raised, and slowly learning to have compassion for sentient beings. Some become unbound when they absorb mortal souls and gain the ability to feel bad about the way their evil masters treat them.

Burden of Sin - Succubi and Incubi have a penalty of -10 to all interactions with people who think that demons could not possibly be turned to good, regardless of exposure to non-evil energy and souls.

Charming Gaze - Succubi and Incubi are constantly casting *Charm Monster* through eye contact, with a caster level equal to their experience level. Consequently, most unbound succubi and incubi avert their gaze, wear veils, or wear mirrored sunglasses.

Demonic Wings - Succubi and Incubi have large bat wings that can be used to glide, slowfall, and gain altitude on strong updrafts. At experience level 10, they can fly close to the ground. At experience level 20, they can fly normally.

Draining Touch - Succubi and Incubi can choose for their unarmed and natural weapon attacks to be draining. The choice is made before rolling attack accuracy. A successful draining attack will absorb half of the damage as hit points.

Hellish Home - Succubi and Incubi are native to environments of pure pain caused by fire or ice. They are completely immune to fire and cold damage, and can breathe in hellish environments normally.

Lethal Kiss - The kiss of a succubus or incubus requires the target to make a Constitution save, or else be drained of 1 point of Constitution. If the target is at 0 or fewer HP, then the succubus or incubus can drain all of the target's Constitution in one kiss. The succubus or incubus keeps track of how much Constitution they have drained throughout their lifetimes as an "Eaten Constitution" number.

Life Force Sustenance - Succubi and Incubi do not need any food or drink, instead subsisting on Eaten Constitution. They stay the equivalent of well-fed and well-hydrated by using 1 Eaten Constitution per month.
