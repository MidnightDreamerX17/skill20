# Draconian

Draconians are born as a result of dragons shapeshifting and mating with mortals. Female dragons would have had to stay shapeshifted for at least 9 months, if not more. If Draconians mate with other mortals, then the offspring will not inherit the dragon nature.

**Physical Appearance:** One extreme of Draconian appearance is a human with horns and a big dragon tail. The other extreme is a human-height dragon that stands upright and has humanoid hands.
