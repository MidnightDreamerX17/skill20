## Orc Hybrid History

Orc Hybrids do not naturally exist - not even if an orc and another race purposely try to breed as much as they can. They are mass-produced for the purpose of ruling over orcs and exercising some amount of independent thought. This same independent thought is what allows a few of them to break free of their mental conditioning and become adventurers.
