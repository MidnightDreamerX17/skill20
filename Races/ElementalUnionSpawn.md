# Elemental Union Spawn

Elemental Union Spawn are descended from one of the four basic elements. They possess inherent magic due to their bodily natures which does not require concentration. Inherent spells base their caster level solely on the Elemental Union Spawn's experience level.

If they mate with mortals, the children will not inherit the elemental nature.

Elemental Rejuvenation - Elemental Union Spawn can rest while immersed in their primary element, causing them to regain an additional hit point during rest. They also maintain their youth this way. They reverse 1 day of unnatural aging during such a boosted rest as well.

Volatile Reactions - All Elemental Union Spawn have a penalty of -2 to all reactions with other elementals and their spawn. Consequently, it is rare to meet a group of Elemental Union Spawn, let alone a group of different types.
