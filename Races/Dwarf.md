Drinking the Strong Stuff: Dwarves apply both Strength and Constitution bonuses to all saving throws against body-altering effects such as poison, paralysis, polymorph, petrification, etc.

Hard-Headed Resistance: Dwarves apply their Constitution bonus to all saving throws against magic.

Mountainhome Rune: Every Dwarf is associated with a unique rune. They are ageless for as long as the rune remains intact. If they unbind themself from their rune, then they have one year to bind themselves to a new one. If they go for more than a year without a Mountainhome Rune, then they start aging at the same rate as gnomes. The type of rune that a Dwarf is born with grants an extra Craft skill.
