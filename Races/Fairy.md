Fairy Ring - Fairies can teleport to their home fairy ring once per day, even if it is on a different plane. They can return to their previous location by using the fairy ring as a portal, and no one else can follow them.

Fairy Wings - At Experience Level 5, fairies can glide, slowfall, and gain altitude with strong updrafts. At Experience Level 10, fairies can fly close to the ground. At Experience Level 20, fairies can fly normally.

Magic Dust - Fairies can use their own body dust for spell components, but this only works for their own spells and cannot be shared with non-fairies. Fairies can also use their dust to draw holy symbols, but again, this only works for their own spells.
