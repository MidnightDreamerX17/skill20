Insectoid Brain - You only need half as much sleep as humans. You can do a long rest in only 4 hours rather than 8. You retain all senses while sleeping, so that you oppose people trying to sneak up on you as if you were still awake. You are immune to all sleep and unconsciousness effects from magic, psionics, chemicals, poisons, and other external sources.

Insectoid Weapon Training - You gain a bonus of +1 to accuracy with two-handed polearms and throwing darts.

Multiple Limbs - You can do simple actions with your extra limbs, such as opening doors and holding onto objects. If the GM is using the optional feat system, then you are allowed to buy triple-wielding and quadruple-wielding feats.
