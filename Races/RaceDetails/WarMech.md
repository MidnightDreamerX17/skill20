# War-Mech

War-Mechs were invented and manufactured on a Prime Material world. Consequently, they are not strongly associated with any alignment plane. Of course, those who follow their original war-oriented programming will find the Lawful Neutral-Evil Plane to be the most suitable.

War-Mechs are constructs that were given souls so that they can wage war independently, but this causes a number of tradeoffs compared to soul-less constructs. Unlike Law-Mechs, they have no fleshy bits.

Field Repairs - War-Mechs can be repaired as constructs for one hit point per day, with the difficulty being equal to 10 + the War-Mech's own experience level. This is in addition to hit points regained by maintenance.

Life Spark - War-Mechs have souls that receive half the effect of divine healing and harming. Keep in mind that *Potions of Cure* and the like are divine in nature, deriving their power from cleric or druid magic. *Raise Dead*, *Resurrection*, *True Resurrection*, *Reincarnation*, and the like will still work normally. Their physical attributes (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) cannot be drained.

Maintenance - War-Mechs require roughly eight hours of maintenance every day, but unlike most mortals, these hours do not need to be contiguous. Without proper maintenance, they will eventually break down and die after 10 years. If they are properly maintained, then they can last forever.

Nuclear-Biological-Chemical Filtration - War-Mechs are immune to poison, disease, paralysis, nausea, sickening, and the like.

Power Plant - War-Mechs cannot be tired, fatigued, or exhausted. They are immune to sleep. They do not eat or drink. They keep coming and they will not stop.
