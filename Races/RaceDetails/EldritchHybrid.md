# Eldritch Hybrid

Eldritch Hybrids are mortals who have had body parts and organs from powerful creatures implanted into their bodies. In many cases, this creates horrific scars, or wounds that never heal. It is impossible for an Eldritch Hybrid to be born normally, and they are also completely sterile - they always started out as normal mortals.

The GM may further rule that the process of creating an Eldritch Hybrid is controlled solely by some mysterious organization.

Eldritch Hybrids can often be identified by their silver-white hair and silver-reflective eyes.

Body Part Attachment - Eldritch Hybrids can trade arms, legs, and other body parts with each other, as well as with Aberration-category monsters. It is possible to impart unique combat techniques into a body part, then give it to another Eldritch Hybrid so that they can use those unique techniques for as long as they have the part attached. *Regeneration* and similar effects do not modify body parts that had come from someone else, except to repair damage.

Monstrous Absorption - Eldritch Hybrids can eat fleshy monsters normally, and can gain the most recent memories from eaten monsters.

Monstrous Instincts - Eldritch Hybrids can spend a movement action to enter or end the state of Monstrous Instincts. During this state, they burn 1 point of Intelligence per round (10 seconds) in order to gain a bonus of +2 to attack accuracy, damage, Armor Class, and hit point regeneration. When Intelligence reaches 0, they turn into unique monsters based on their own personality and the eldritch pieces inside of them, and their character sheets are permanently handed over to the GM. If ended in time, then Intelligence returns at a rate of 1 per minute (6 rounds).

At experience level 10, Wisdom can be burned to retain control during the fully-monstrous state. Furthermore, the fully-monstrous state can be ended with a movement action if Wisdom is still above 0. After ending the fully-monstrous state, Wisdom is prioritized for recovery before Intelligence.

Monster Sense - Eldritch Hybrids gain a bonus of +2 to perceive fleshy monsters by any available sense - smell, sight, hearing the monster's voice, etc. This also applies to other Eldritch Hybrids.

Silver Witchcraft - Eldritch Hybrids are feared as dangerous beings, or even suspected of being in league with monsters. They have a penalty of -5 to all interactions with those who fear monsters of any kind. This penalty is typically reduced to only -2 in environments where people could be both allied with or opposed to various types of monsters, such as in the alignment planes.
