Collective Gnomish Consciousness - Gnomes can maintain physical contact in order to share spell energies, psionic power points, and chi power points. The recipient must possess the skill levels that would allow them to have the power normally. For example, a Gnome sharing Cleric spell energies requires the recipient to have the Cleric Power skill.

Innate Magical Playfulness - Gnomes can memorize any Illusionist spell of the 0th circle into any memorization slot, without needing a spellbook.

Magical Passthrough - Gnomes add their Constitution and Intelligence bonuses to all saving throws against magic.

Mental Mapping - Gnomes always know their orientation, as well as their distance traveled in all directions.
