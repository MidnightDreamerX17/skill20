# Ore'a'dian Orcnea

Ore'a'dian Orcneas were created by a wizard who wanted to engineer the perfect warrior slave race. The wizard derived much of their essence from Demonic Union Spawn. Even now, Orcneas are still strongly associated with varieties of evil spirits.

An Ore'a'dian Orcnea counts as an "orc" for magical and psionic purposes.

Battle Mind - Ore'a'dian Orcneas are engineered to be able to maintain battle discipline under any circumstances, at the cost of all other brain functions. They can spend one action to enter the Battle Mind, which makes them ignore all external stimuli, bright lights, sleep, charm, confusion, stunning, dazing, and other mind-altering effects except from other orcneas in the same formation. The Battle Mind state also removes need for concentration checks, unless physically prevented from performing verbal and somatic spell components. Orcneas can spend another action to end Battle Mind at any time afterwards.

Extreme Omnivorousness - Ore'a'dian Orcneas can eat rotten food as if it was normal. They can eat foul-tasting creatures with no ill effects. They also gain a bonus of +4 to resist poison, disease, nausea, sickening, and other such effects.

Horns - Ore'a'dian Orcneas have noticeable horns. For males, they are big enough to grab by the hands, and can be used to headbutt as a natural weapon for 1d4 piercing damage. For females, they are rounded and stubby, so cannot be grabbed.

Orc Equivalent - Since Ore'a'dian Orcneas count as orcs, are associated with evil spirits along with ettins and dark elves, and look the way they do, they suffer from severe discrimination. Ore'a'dian Orcneas suffer a penalty of -10 to interactions with those who know orcs primarily as a tool of evil.

Scent Tracking - Ore'a'dian Orcneas gain a bonus of +2 to checks involving scent, smell, and taste. They can use their enhanced sense of smell to track targets.

Tusks - Ore'a'dian Orcneas have four big tusks that stick out noticeably - two in each row of teeth. They can bite as a natural weapon for 1d6 piercing damage.
