Elven Martial Traditions - Elves gain the advantages of Weapon Category Specialization (Archery) and Weapon Category Specialization (Swords, Straight, One-Handed) for free.

Long Maturation - Elves must be 100 years old before they are physically-mature to the same point as an 18-year-old human. They gain a bonus Knowledge skill of choice.

Soul Integrity - Elves are immune to sleep and charm.

Origin Tree - Every Elf is linked to a tree that contains a shard of the original light of creation. Elves are ageless for as long as the tree lasts. If their origin tree dies, then they begin aging again, although still extremely slowly compared to all other mortal races. Elves can only produce offspring when their origin tree has grown enough to accommodate a new linked elf, or if they plant another tree descended from their origin tree.

Tree Lineage - Every Elf is affected by the origin trees of their first bloodlines on the plane of Alfar-Avalon - even if their other ancestors have bound themselves to different trees since then.
