Armor Body, Literally - Possessed Armors start with an additional 100 gold for buying weapons, armor, and shields. However, they must deal with armor weight normally, representing skill in inhabiting and moving their armor bodies as effectively as a normal person.

No Fleshy Bits - Possessed Armors do not require food, water, sleep, or rest. In fact they are immune to magical and psionic sleep, dazing, stunning, fatigue, exhaustion, etc. They can still suffer from dazing and stunning if the effect is caused by helmet damage. They can also still suffer from fatigue or exhausting if their armor rivets and threads are damaged.

Undead - Possessed Armors are undead. They also take damage from holy water. They suffer a penalty of -10 to all interactions with people who think that undead must be inherently evil, or that necromancy exists solely for evil.
