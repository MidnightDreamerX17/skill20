# Ore'a'dian Knocker

Ore'a'dian Knockers were created during the wars of the gods. They were intended to serve a variety of roles in entrenchment, fortress-building, mining, sapping, tunnel scouting, and other such subterranean tasks. It is rumored that there may still be isolated knocker tribes who do not know that the wars of the gods ended thousands of years ago - tribes who still fight against everything they meet.

An Ore'a'dian Knocker counts as a "kobold" for magical and psionic purposes.

Anoxia Survival - Ore'a'dian Knockers can hold their breath for up to 1 hour at a time, although they must conserve energy with a walking pace or slower during this time. They can also survive for up to 24 hours in an oxygen-less coma state. They only need 2 rounds (20 seconds) to recover from carbon monoxide poisoning, carbon dioxide poisoning, and the like when they gain access to fresh air.

Fungal Diet - Ore'a'dian Knockers are immune to all mushrooms, molds, jellies, oozes, puddings, gelatinous creatures, and the like. Knockers can also eat said things as if they were normal food.

Gas Taste - Ore'a'dian Knockers can smell and taste the difference between carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, propane, butane, helium, krypton, and other such gases that could cause poisoning or displace oxygen. They also gain a bonus of +2 to smell anything else.

Internal Compasses - Ore'a'dian Knockers have multiple magnetosensitive organs in their heads. They can discern between multiple magnetic objects, and can almost always discern the north and south poles of the world.

Kobold Equivalent - Since Ore'a'dian Knockers count as kobolds, are associated with evil spirits along with goblins and dark elves, and look the way they do, they suffer from severe discrimination. Ore'a'dian Knockers suffer a penalty of -10 to interactions with those who know kobolds primarily as a tool of evil.
