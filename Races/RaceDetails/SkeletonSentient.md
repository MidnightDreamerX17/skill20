# Skeleton, Sentient

Most skeletons are created by binding dark energies to bones, under the control of a necromancer or cleric. A few skeletons have complete souls bound to them, either intentionally or by the accident of the necromancer.

No Fleshy Bits - Skeletons do not require food, water, sleep, or rest. In fact they are immune to magical and psionic sleep, dazing, stunning, fatigue, exhaustion, etc. They can still suffer from dazing and stunning if the effect is caused by skull damage. They can also still suffer from fatigue or exhausting if their bones are damaged.

Skull Only (Option) - Some sentient skeletons have been reduced to a floating skull. A floating skull is always floating, does not trigger floor traps or tripwires, and is capable of gliding and slowfalling at will. On the other hand, it has no arms, so must hold objects in its mouth. They only require the helmet component of armor, so they pay 20% price for armor. However, they must deal with armor weight normally, since the helmet weighs down their floating abilities significantly.

Undead - Skeletons are undead. They also take damage from holy water. They suffer a penalty of -10 to all interactions with people who think that undead must be inherently evil, or that necromancy exists solely for evil.
