# Ore'a'dian Troll

Ore'a'dian Trolls were created to be hunter-killers during the wars between the gods. Specifically, they were created to be able to survive the incredible devastation of the land and sustain themselves across long distances. Long after the wars between the gods ended, trolls naturally thrived and spread out.

An Ore'a'dian Troll counts as a "troll" for magical and psionic purposes.

Extreme Environment Resistance - Ore'a'dian Trolls were engineered by the gods to be able to survive god-stricken environments. They take half damage from environmental conditions, radiation, vacuum, and the like.

Radiation Scent - Ore'a'dian Trolls can sense radiation levels simply by smelling and tasting it.

Shielded Digestion - Ore'a'dian Trolls can eat rotten, irradiated, and burned meat as if it were normal. They also gain a bonus of +4 to save against poison, disease, sickening, nausea, and similar effects.

Troll Equivalent - Since Ore'a'dian Trolls count as trolls, are associated with evil spirits along with ettins and giants, and look the way they do, they suffer from severe discrimination. Ore'a'dian Trolls suffer a penalty of -10 to interactions with those who know trolls primarily as a tool of evil.

Troll Regeneration - Ore'a'dian Trolls regenerate 1 hit point per combat round, plus an additional hit point for every fifth experience level. For example, an Ore'a'dian Troll at experience level 10 will regenerate a total of 3 hit points per combat round. They can reattach severed limbs. With help from allies, they can even reattach their heads to their bodies, although they cannot do this by themselves.

Weak to Fire - Ore'a'dian Trolls cannot regenerate while on fire. They also take double damage from effects that could set them on fire (not necessarily the same thing as heat).
