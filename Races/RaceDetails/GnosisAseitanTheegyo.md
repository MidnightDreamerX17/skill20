Know Your Enemies - Must hate Biastis-Impetus-Anima (Bia) and Actualized Eldritch Dreamers (E-Dreamers), and have a penalty of -10 to all reactions with them.

Know Your Family - Allow nothing to hinder the survival of the Gnosa as a whole.

Know Your Freedom - Do not allow anyone else to ever enslave them again. A Gnosa must also avoid being personally enslaved in any way. Obligations and duties to anything other than their own race are distressing as well, e.g. owing your life to someone or making a promise to a non-Gnosa.

Know Your Home - Gnosa are attuned to the shaping of chaos matter, live among it, and have been mutated by it. They gain a bonus of +2 to all checks relating to chaos matter.

Know Your Magic Resistance - Gnosa have an inherent Spell Resistance number equal to 10 + Experience Level. Furthermore, in order for a Gnosa to use or equip a magic item, they must make a check to beat their own Spell Resistance. On a failure, the Gnosa do not gain the magical benefits of that item, instead treating it as mundane gear.

The Gnosa may choose to use a magic power skill as a penalty to their Spell Resistance for 24 hours at a time. For example, if a Gnosa has Wizard Power (INT) at level 5, then they can suppress their Spell Resistance by up to 5.

## Gnosa History

The Gnosis-Aseitan Theegyo were originally part of the main Theegyo race. The Theegyo were enslaved by the Actualized Eldritch Dreamers (E-Dreamers) and subjected to horrific conditions. They successfully rebelled and escaped from the grasp of the E-Dreamers, but then found themselves fighting hard to survive in esoteric planes.

Once Theegyo society finally stabilized and was able to form a new civilization, two competing ideologies gained prominence. One was championed by Nok-kad Therz, a swordmaster and popular hero of the original rebellion. Therz advocated knowledge, discipline, self-control, focus, and purging the mind of all non-useful thoughts. The opposing ideology was championed by Thig Iyanki, a general who had led many battles in the new civilization era. Iyanki was popular thanks to his grandiose speeches and his displays of power, both psionic and magical. Iyanki advocated that everyone give in to their most basic and primitive desires, and that they should seek nihilistic self-indulgence, even if it could potentially result in death. The two ideologies went to civil war, nearly extinguishing the Theegyo civilization for the second time since their enslavement by the E-Dreamers.

They agreed to a truce and took their people to different planes. The followers of Therz became the Gnosis-Aseitan (Gnosa) Theegyo, while the followers of Iyanki became the Biastis-Impetus-Anima (Bia) Theegyo. The two peoples underwent rapid evolution because of the combination of teachings, natural psionic nature, planar energies in their homelands, and other such factors. It was as if their ideologies were directing their biologies towards divergent paths. Now, the Gnosa and Bia are two different races, and incompatible with each other.

The main homeland of the Gnosa is a fortress-metropolis in the Chaotic-Neutral Plane, although they have spread out to all the other planes as well.
