## Human Vices

Envy - Opposite to Kindness. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 20 to avoid flipping out and going nuts when they see that someone has something - for example a spouse, a house, a piece of equipment, or a mouse - that is better than what the character has. On a failure, it proves to be highly distracting and causes a penalty of -5 to the character's next roll.

Gluttony - Opposite to Temperance. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 20 to avoid spending 20% of their earned gold-equivalent value on things like beer, food, and food cooked in beer batter.

Greed - Opposite to Charity. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 20 to invest in something long-term, unless other bankers say that it is a sure bet. The character must also make a check to avoid get-rich-quick schemes that are obviously going to fail.

Lust - Opposite to Chastity. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 20 to avoid spending 20% of their earned gold-equivalent value on things like wine, men, and women.

Pride - Opposite to Humility. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 20 to avoid insulting people who are perceived to be inferior, as well as to avoid making ridiculous self-inflated claims. Examples of prideful statements include and are not limited to, "I aced school. You need to get a degree at a reputable university."

Sloth - Opposite to Diligence. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 20 to avoid taking twice as long to do a non-combat action, such as picking a lock.

Wrath - Opposite to Patience. The character must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check at Difficulty 10 to avoid flipping out and killing people for perceived slights and insults. If someone is purposely antagonizing the character, then the difficulty is 20 or higher.
