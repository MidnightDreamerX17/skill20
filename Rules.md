# Rules

Skill checks generally consist of 1d20 + Skill level + Attribute modifier. There are only a few special cases that will use an attribute that the skill is not associated with. For example, Melee Fighting is associated with Strength, but may use Dexterity instead for finesse weapons.

Attribute checks generally consist of 1d20 + Experience level + Attribute modifier. Attribute checks include saving throws, most types of perception, and the like. Attribute checks basically cover everything that is not claimed by a skill.

If a check requires a skill, and the character does not have the skill, then it will be an *unskilled check*. This means 1d20 + Attribute modifier only. Note that all saving throws and most types of perception do not require skills, so they are typically *attribute checks* instead.

The average difficulty of a check is 10.

If the d20 shows a 20 (often called a "natural 20") then the check is a guaranteed success, regardless of the difficulty. Therefore, even the gods prepare multiple safeguards against some random lucky stranger trying to do bad stuff to them.

If the d20 shows a 1 (often called a "natural 1") then the check is a guaranteed failure, regardless of the difficulty.

## Time Scales

- 1 Combat Round = 10 seconds
- 1 minute = 6 combat rounds = 60 seconds
- 10 minutes = 60 combat rounds = 600 seconds
- 1 hour = 360 combat rounds = 3,600 seconds

## Extended Checks

Extended Checks have a Threshold difficulty and a Time Scale Per Check.

Extended Checks can only be failed if the GM defines failure as an inability to attain the threshold within a certain number of checks.

## Rest and Recovery

8 hours of rest can be defined as:

- Sleeping for a solid 8 hours
- Laying around and doing no strenuous activity for 8 hours
- Playing games and other non-physical amusements for 8 hours

Characters regain 1 hit point per period of rest, plus their Constitution bonus. For example, having a Constitution of 14 will cause 2 additional hit points to be restored during a full rest period.

Healing / Healer's Kits can be used to restore a number of hit points equal to the target's Constitution score. However, this requires an extended check with a difficulty of 100, and a time scale of 1 hour per roll.

## Learning New Skills

The fastest way to learn new skills is to perform the following steps:

1. Find a guild, order, temple, etc. that is willing to teach you the skill. **Advanced** skills generally require that you have achieved the rank of Master in a guild before a guildmaster will teach you one.
2. Train for a week. Magic and psionic skills require between two weeks to a month, although the GM may rule that already having one set of magic skills could make it faster to learn other types of magic. Advanced skills require a whole month.
3. Pay 100 XP for the first level of the skill.

It is also possible for a character to learn skills from their own party members. This requires 100 XP plus additional requirements. The requirements for such a process are detailed in each skill's description. Typically, learning skills from other party members takes a much longer time, since the full set of guild instructors, facilities, books, magical teaching aids, psionic teaching aids, etc. are not present.

## Combat

Combat is divided into 10-second **rounds** in which each combatant has a **turn**. Each 10-second **round** is composed of two phases:

1. Initiative phase
2. Actions phase

On a combatant's **turn**, they may do the following:

- One set of attacks, and one movement
- Start casting a spell or manifesting a power, and one movement
- Start reading a scroll, and one movement
- Use an item, and one movement

### Initiative Phase

Each combatant rolls 1d100 + Dexterity score for initiative. For example, if a character has 16 Dexterity and rolls 45, then their initiative is 61.

Combatants act in order from highest to lowest initiative.

To save time, the GM may decide that combatants only roll for initiative at the beginning of combat, and then keep those initiative numbers for the entire battle.

To save even more time, the GM may decide that the player side rolls 1d100, then the enemy side rolls 1d100. Whoever wins, their whole side goes first. For each side's turn, the combatants go in order from highest to lowest Dexterity.

### Attacks

All combatants have a base of 1 attack per round, with additional attacks from the Melee Fighting (STR) and Ranged Fighting (DEX) skills. All attacks in one round must be either melee or ranged. The optional feats system may provide a way to mix specific types of melee and ranged attacks.

For melee attack accuracy, the attacker rolls 1d20 + Melee Fighting (STR) + Strength modifier. Some weapons are designated as "finesse" weapons, meaning that they use Dexterity modifier instead of Strength modifier.

For ranged attack accuracy, the attacker rolls 1d20 + Ranged Fighting (DEX) + Dexterity modifier. Ranged attacks against a target beyond one range increment have a penalty of -2. Each additional range increment of distance further causes a -2 penalty.

If the d20 shows a 20 (often called a "natural 20") then the attack is a guaranteed hit, regardless of the target's Armor Class. Therefore, even the mightiest and most ironclad of warriors can inevitably be felled if they try to take on an army by themselves.

If the d20 shows a 1 (often called a "natural 1") then the attack is a guaranteed miss, regardless of the attacker's accuracy.

On a successful hit that meets or exceeds the target's Armor Class, the attacker then rolls for damage. Most melee weapons add Strength modifier to damage, but finesse weapons add Dexterity modifier to damage instead. Ranged weapons add Dexterity modifier to damage.

The damage is subtracted from the target's current Hit Points.

### Movement, Range, and Positioning

#### Map Combat

Each combatant has a movement speed. They can move at their full movement speed during their turn. They can also choose to sacrifice all their actions in order to move at double movement speed.

When moving past an enemy, the mover and enemy make opposed Dexterity checks. If the mover wins, then they can continue movement unimpeded. If the enemy wins, then the movement is halted. The mover can expend 10 feet of movement in order to get an additional attempt. One can imagine that an extremely fast combatant would spend three or more attempts to get past a dextrous foe.

Attacks to a target's backside gain a bonus of +4 to accuracy.

If a combatant is in melee with at least one enemy, then the combatant is considered to be facing that enemy. If the combatant is in melee with two or more enemies, then they must choose which enemy they are facing. Some special tactics may force combatants to face in a specific direction, or force their shields to only be useful in one direction.

#### Map-less Combat

Each side of combatants has a front row and a back row.

Side A Front Row: Melee attacks against Side B's front row, or reach attacks against Side B's back row.

Side A Back Row: Reach & ranged attacks against Side B's front row, or ranged attacks against Side B's back row.

#### Special Maneuvers

**Alley-Oop** - An alley-oop maneuver requires two combatants. First, they must plan the maneuver in such a way that their turns are adjacent in the initiative order. The first combatant throws an object at the second one, within the object's throwing range increment. Then, the second combatant throws the object as an attack with a bonus of +4 to accuracy.

**Blitz** - A blitz maneuver requires at least three combatants on both sides. First, two of the blitzers attempt to body-block two of the enemies with a bonus of +4 to the d20 rolls. Then, the third blitzer may move into melee with the third enemy without any possibility of getting body-blocked by the first two enemies.

**Full Defense** - The combatant does not do anything other than defending. They gain a bonus to Armor Class against melee attacks equal to half of their Melee Fighting (STR) skill, and a bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks equal to half of their Ranged Fighting (DEX) skill.

**Point Defense** - The combatant chooses one target, and forgoes all actions. When the target moves, the combatant may then move to intercept, attempt to body-block the target, and attack the target. After this, the target may then choose to finish its action by attacking the point-defender. Note that this is **not** any kind of technique "of opportunity," but rather, a special type of delayed action. Techniques "of opportunity" **do not exist in Skill20**.

**Precise Shot** - The attacker cannot move, nor do anything else other than ranged attacks. All attacks must be directed at one target. The attacker gains a bonus of +4 to accuracy.

**Reckless Attack** - The attacker takes a penalty of -2 to Armor Class in order to add 1 accuracy to attacks. The effect lasts until the beginning of the attacker's next action. The maximum amount of Armor Class that may be spent in this manner is 10.

**Zone Defense** - The combatant establishes a zone defense in a radius within its movement speed. The combatant forgoes all actions. When an enemy enters the zone, the combatant may then move to intercept, attempt to body-block the enemy, and attack the enemy. After this, the enemy may then choose to finish its action by attacking the zone-defender. Note that this is **not** any kind of technique "of opportunity," but rather, a special type of delayed action. Techniques "of opportunity" **do not exist in Skill20**.

#### Formation Tactics

**Creeping Barrage** - All participants must be facing in one direction. Actions must always alternate between an attempt at area-of-effect damage, and a move-and-attack. The move-and-attack must always enter the area where the previous area-of-effect damage attempt occurred. The area-of-effect damage attempt must always target a position within 5 feet of the previous attempt. The participants assigned to move-and-attack gain a bonus of +4 to armor class and +4 to accuracy.

**Shield Wall** - All participants must be using a shield, and form a shoulder-to-shoulder line. Their shields now only apply to attacks from the front. The Armor Class from their shields is doubled.

**Shoot and Move** - The participants must be split into at least two groups trying to flank a target position. Oftentimes, three groups are used. The target position is any contiguous area, such as a 30-foot-radius tower or a 60-foot-long trench. The participants must alternate between holding still and doing a precise shot, and sprinting. The participants gain a bonus of +4 to Armor Class and +4 to accuracy relative to the target position.

**Shooting Volley** - All participants must be using a point-and-shoot weapon, and form a shoulder-to-shoulder line. The best initiative result of any of the participants is applied to everyone in the formation, and they all act in unison. They all fire their weapons straight-forward on the same round. They gain a bonus of +4 to accuracy. If they all have firearms, then they also cause a morale penalty of -8 to animals who are not trained to withstand the sounds of gunfire.

**Skirmisher Volley** - All participants must be using a throwing weapon, and form a web in which each participant is within 10 feet of at least 1 other participant. The best initiative result of any of the participants is applied to everyone in the formation, and they all act in unison. They move half their movement forwards, do a throwing weapon attack, and use the remainder of their movement to return to their original positions.

**Spear Wall** - All participants must be using a spear or polearm, and form a shoulder-to-shoulder line. Their shields, if any, now only apply to attacks from the front. The participants gain a bonus of +4 to Armor Class from frontal melee attacks, and automatically get one free attack against any enemy who comes within straight-frontal weapon range.

### Spellcasting and Psionics in Combat

To repeat from Chapter 7: [Magic](/Magic), spellcasting always takes a minimum of a full round. The spellcaster starts the process of casting the spell as their action, and the spell takes effect immediately before their next turn. Every time the spellcaster takes damage during this time, they must make a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the spellcaster. On a failure, the spellcasting is interrupted, but they do not expend the spell energy.

To repeat from Chapter 8: [Psionics](/Psionics), manifestation of powers always takes a minimum of a full round. The manifester starts the process of manifesting the power as their action, and the power takes effect immediately before their next turn. Every time the manifester takes damage during this time, they must make a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the manifester. On a failure, the manifestation is interrupted, but they do not expend the psionic power points.

Spell and Power Resistance: The spellcaster or manifester must make a skill check to defeat the resistance. On a failure, the spell energy is wasted, or the psionic power points are wasted. Magic is not affected by psionic resistance. Psionic powers are not affected by spell resistance.

#### Optional: Faster Casting and Manifestation

The GM may rule that spells and psionic powers finish execution at the end of the character's turn, thus eliminating the possibility that concentration could be required.

### Grappling

Grappling is divided into three separate actions: takedowns, position changes, and attacks.

#### Takedowns

If the Takedown check is successful, then you start grappling and have Grappling Advantage. On a natural 20, you may then attempt a position change or attack. On a failure, grappling is not initiated. On a natural 1, the opponent may choose either Grappling Advantage or a free melee attack.

Clinching Takedown: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Strength modifier

Tackling Takedown: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Dexterity modifier

Tripping Takedown: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Wisdom modifier

#### Position Changes

Grappling Advantage gives a bonus of +5.

If the Position Change check is successful, then you gain Grappling Advantage. If you already have Grappling Advantage, then you gain a bonus of +5 to your next grappling attack. On a natural 1, the opponent gains Grappling Advantage.

Push and Pull: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Strength modifier

Scramble: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Dexterity modifier

Reversal: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Wisdom modifier. Cannot be done if you already have advantage.

#### Attacks

Grappling Advantage gives a bonus of +5.

On a natural 20, the effect is doubled. On a natural 1, the opponent gains Grappling Advantage.

Submission: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Strength modifier. Temporarily decreases the target's Strength and Constitution by 1, lasting for an hour. Additional successes with submission will continue to harm the target's Strength and Constitution. Typically, the target will fall unconscious long before it goes to negative Constitution.

Slam: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Strength modifier. 1d12 + (Strength modifier) damage, and causes the target to be stunned for one round.

Short Strikes: d20 check of Melee Fighting + Dexterity modifier. Do damage as if from an unarmed strike.

### Dual-Wielding (and more)

Dual-Wielding gives a bonus of +1 to attack accuracy. The dual-wielder also chooses which weapon is used for accuracy, and which one is used for damage. Any special parrying bonuses from both weapons are applied.

Triple-Wielding gives a bonus of +2 to attack accuracy, while Quadruple-Wielding gives a bonus of +3.

## Status Definitions

**Attribute Damage / Ability Damage / Ability Drain** - The character's attribute functions at a lower number.

**Blinded** - The character cannot see. The character takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, loses the Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -4 penalty on most Strength-based and Dexterity-based skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and visual searching checks) automatically fail. The character has a penalty of -10 to attack accuracy as well.

**Blown Away** - A creature that is blow across the floor takes 1d4 points of damage per 10 feet. A creature that is blown into a wall takes 2d6 points of damage.

**Confused** - A confused character’s actions are determined by rolling d100 at the beginning of its turn:

| Confusion Roll | Result |
| ---            | ---    |
| 01 - 10 | Attack the one who caused the *Confusion*
| 11 - 20 | Act normally
| 21 - 50 | Do nothing but babble incoherently
| 51 - 70 | Run away from the one who caused the *Confusion* at maximum possible speed
| 71 - 100 | Attack the nearest creature

**Cowering** - The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class and loses Dexterity bonus (if any).

**Dazed** - The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.

**Dazzled** - The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on all physical actions and physical saving throws.

**Deafened** - A deafened character cannot hear. The character takes a -40 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails auditory perception checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.

**Entangled** - The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -2 penalty on all accuracy rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell with somatic components has a 20% chance of spell failure.

**Exhausted** - An exhausted character moves at half speed and takes a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes *fatigued*. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.

**Experience Level Damage / Negative Levels / Level Drain** - Not only does this decrease the character's effective experience level, but it also imposes a cap on the effectiveness of their skills. Skills cannot function at a level higher than current experience level, while under the effect of experience level damage. This could cause the character to have a lower number of spell energies, spell memorization slots, psionic power points, etc. It could also cause the character to be unable to memorize higher-circle spells, or unable to manifest higher-circle powers.

**Fascinated** - A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a -4 penalty on all d20 rolls. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature’s ally may shake it free as an attack or move action.

**Fatigued** - A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become *exhausted*. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.

**Frightened** - A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

**Helpless** - A helpless character is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent’s mercy. Attacks against helpless creatures gain a bonus of +10 to accuracy. It is possible to do careful attacks against vital points for double damage, if the helpless creature has any such vital points.

**Invisible** - Visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a bonus of +2 to accuracy against opponents.

**Nauseated** - Experiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move action per turn.

**Panicked** - A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers as if *helpless*. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

**Petrified** - A petrified character has been turned to stone. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as the character returns to flesh, then the character is unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation, which would require *Regeneration* to heal.

**Prone** - The character is on the ground. A character who is prone gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.

**Shaken** - A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls.

**Sickened** - A sickened character takes a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls.

**Staggered** - A staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can the character take full-round actions).

**Stunned** - A stunned creature drops everything held, can’t take actions, and takes a -2 penalty to AC and d20 rolls.
