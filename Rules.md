# Rules

Skill checks generally consist of 1d20 + (Attribute bonus) + Skill level. There are only a few special cases that will use an attribute that the skill is not associated with. For example, Melee Fighting is associated with Strength, but may use Dexterity instead for finesse weapons.

Non-skill checks generally consist of 1d20 + (Attribute bonus) + Experience level.

The average difficulty of a check is 10.

## Extended Checks

Extended Checks have a Threshold difficulty and a Time Scale Per Check.

Extended Checks can only be failed if the GM defines failure as an inability to attain the threshold within a certain number of checks.

## Rest and Recovery

8 hours of rest can be defined as:

- Sleeping for a solid 8 hours
- Laying around and doing no strenuous activity for 8 hours
- Playing games and other non-physical amusements for 8 hours

Characters regain 1 hit point per period of rest.

Healing Kits can be used to restore a number of hit points equal to the target's Constitution score. However, this requires an extended check with a difficulty of 100, and a time scale of 1 hour per roll.

## Combat

### Initiative

Each combatant rolls 1d100 + Dexterity score for initiative. For example, if a character has 16 Dexterity and rolls 45, then their initiative is 61.

Combatants act in order from highest to lowest initiative.

To save time, the GM may decide that combatants only roll for initiative at the beginning of combat, and then keep those initiative numbers for the entire battle.

To save even more time, the GM may decide that the player side rolls 1d100, then the enemy side rolls 1d100. Whoever wins, their whole side goes first. For each side's turn, the combatants go in order from highest to lowest Dexterity.

### Movement, Range, and Positioning

#### Map Combat

Each combatant has a movement speed. They can move at their full movement speed during their turn. They can also choose to sacrifice all their actions in order to move at double movement speed.

When moving past an enemy, the mover and enemy make opposed Dexterity checks. If the mover wins, then they can continue movement unimpeded. If the enemy wins, then the movement is halted. The mover can expend 10 feet of movement in order to get an additional attempt. One can imagine that an extremely fast combatant would spend three or more attempts to get past a dextrous foe.

#### Map-less Combat

Each side of combatants has a front row and a back row.

Side A Front Row: Melee attacks against Side B's front row, or reach attacks against Side B's back row.

Side A Back Row: Reach & ranged attacks against Side B's front row, or ranged attacks against Side B's back row.

### Spellcasting and Psionics in Combat

To repeat from Chapter 7: [Magic](/Magic), spellcasting always takes a minimum of a full round. The spellcaster starts the process of casting the spell as their action, and the spell takes effect immediately before their next turn. Every time the spellcaster takes damage during this time, they must make a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the spellcaster. On a failure, the spellcasting is interrupted, but they do not expend the spell energy.

To repeat from Chapter 8: [Psionics](/Psionics), manifestation of powers always takes a minimum of a full round. The manifester starts the process of manifesting the power as their action, and the power takes effect immediately before their next turn. Every time the manifester takes damage during this time, they must make a skill check to maintain concentration. The difficulty is 10 + the Experience Level of the one who did the damage to the manifester. On a failure, the manifestation is interrupted, but they do not expend the psionic power points.

Spell and Power Resistance: The spellcaster or manifester must make a skill check to defeat the resistance. On a failure, the spell energy is wasted, or the psionic power points are wasted. Magic is not affected by psionic resistance. Psionic powers are not affected by spell resistance.

### Grappling

Grappling is divided into three separate actions: takedowns, position changes, and attacks.

#### Takedowns

If the Takedown check is successful, then you start grappling and have Grappling Advantage. On a natural 20, you may then attempt a position change or attack. On a failure, grappling is not initiated. On a natural 1, the opponent may choose either Grappling Advantage or a free melee attack.

Clinching Takedown: Strength + Melee Fighting

Tackling Takedown: Dexterity + Melee Fighting

Tripping Takedown: Wisdom + Melee Fighting

#### Position Changes

Grappling Advantage gives a bonus of +5.

If the Position Change check is successful, then you gain Grappling Advantage. If you already have Grappling Advantage, then you gain a bonus of +5 to your next grappling attack. On a natural 1, the opponent gains Grappling Advantage.

Push and Pull: Strength + Melee Fighting

Scramble: Dexterity + Melee Fighting

Reversal: Wisdom + Melee Fighting. Cannot be done if you already have advantage.

#### Attacks

Grappling Advantage gives a bonus of +5.

On a natural 20, the effect is doubled. On a natural 1, the opponent gains Grappling Advantage.

Submission: Strength + Melee Fighting. Temporarily decreases the target's Strength and Constitution by 1, lasting for an hour. Additional successes with submission will continue to harm the target's Strength and Constitution. Typically, the target will fall unconscious long before it goes to negative Constitution.

Slam: Strength + Melee Fighting. 1d12 + (Strength bonus) damage, and causes the target to be stunned for one round.

Short Strikes: Dexterity + Melee Fighting. Do damage as if from an unarmed strike.
