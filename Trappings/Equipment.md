## Specialty Gear

| Gear | Cost |
| ---  | ---  |
| Acid, 1 flask | 10.00
| Alchemist's Fire, 1 flask | 20.00
| Antitoxin, 1 vial | 50.00
| Everburning Torch | 110.00
| Holy Water, 1 flask | 25.00
| Smokestick | 20.00
| Skull of Planar Knowledge | 2,000.00
| Sunrod | 2.00
| Tanglefoot Bag | 50.00
| Thunderstone | 30.00
| Tindertwig | 1.00

**Acid** - You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a throwing weapon with a map range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.

**Alchemist’s Fire** - You can throw a flask of alchemist’s fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a throwing weapon with a map range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a Difficulty 15 Dexterity save, whilst rolling on the ground. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.

**Antitoxin** - If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Constitution saving throws against poison for 1 hour.

**Everburning Torch**- This otherwise normal torch has a *Continual Flame* spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius.

**Holy Water** - Holy Water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a throwing weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is considered a melee unarmed attack. A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash. Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).

**Smokestick** - This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a *Fog Cloud* spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.

**Sunrod** - This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.

**Tanglefoot Bag** - When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a throwing weapon with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack accuracy rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity checks, and must make a Difficulty 15 Dexterity save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a Difficulty 15 Dexterity save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A *Tanglefoot Bag* does not function underwater.

A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a Difficulty 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack accuracy roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a Difficulty 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.

**Thunderstone** - You can throw this stone as a throwing weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a Difficulty 15 Constitution save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -40 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.

Since you don’t need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.

**Tindertwig** - The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

Healing / Healer's Kits can be used to restore a number of hit points equal to the target's Constitution score. However, this requires an extended check with a difficulty of 100, and a time scale of 1 hour per roll.

Masterwork tools generally give a bonus of +1, if the user has a skill level of at least 5.

Oftentimes, ships must be commissioned with a shipyard of good repute, and the buyer must wait for them to finish building. It is virtually impossible that a brand-new ship would be sitting in a harbor awaiting sale.

**Galley** - Large ship propelled mainly by rowing. Oftentimes, the rowers are slaves, although there are societies who can afford galleys crewed by freemen.

**Galleass** - Hybrids of galleys and fully-rigged sailing ships, in order to move as fast as possible. They are also the most crew-demanding ship type, especially if they have cannons. Consequently, they are used as either fast cargo ships or coastal war ships, but not both.
