# Armor

Armor and shields require the Armor Training skill in order to wear without being burdened. Armor Weight that exceeds Armor Training skill will be a penalty to all physical actions, and will also cancel out the Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. For example, a character with Armor Training Level 10 can wear armor with Armor Weight of up to 10 (such as bullet-proofed plate) before being burdened.
