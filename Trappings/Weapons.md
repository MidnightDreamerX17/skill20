# Weapons

- 2-handed: The weapon requires two hands to wield in the intended manner
- Concealable: The weapon can be visually-hidden in a jacket sleeve.
- Entangling: A successful hit forces a Dexterity check on the target to avoid getting tripped. The difficulty of the check is equal to 5 + the attacker's relevant skill level.
- Finesse: The weapon uses Dexterity bonus rather than Strength bonus, for both accuracy and damage.
- Ignores Shield: The weapon is designed to go around shields and strike the opponent at odd angles. The opponent's shield does not provide any AC against this weapon.
- Ranged: The weapon has full effectiveness at all ranges. It also uses Dexterity bonus rather than Strength bonus, for both accuracy and damage.
- Reach: The weapon has full effectiveness across 7.5 feet / one row.
- Spear Wall: If everyone in your row also has a Spear Wall weapon, and your team matches or exceeds the numbers of the enemy, then everyone in the row gains +4 AC against melee attacks.
- Quickdraw: The weapon can be drawn and used to attack in one action.

## Throwing Bombs (Ranged)

Throwing Bombs are part of the Throwing Weapons And Slings category, except that they deal damage in a very different manner. They have a radius increment, and deal damage to all targets within the radius. They then do half damage in the second radius increment, one-fourth damage in the third radius increment, and so on.

The attacker rolls for attack accuracy and damage once. Then the accuracy result is compared to the Armor Class of each target separately. Each target that is "hit" takes the normal amount of damage. Each target that is "missed" takes half damage.

When hitting a scattering swarm that has a special way to limit damage from area-of-effect magic, throwing bombs can kill 1 additional creature per 5 feet of base radius. They can also kill 1 additional creature if they have at least 2 damage dice.
