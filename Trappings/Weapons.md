- 2-handed: The weapon requires two hands to wield in the intended manner

- Reach: The weapon has full effectiveness across one row.
- Spear Wall: If everyone in your row also has a Spear Wall weapon, and your team matches or exceeds the numbers of the enemy, then everyone in the row gains +4 AC against melee attacks.
