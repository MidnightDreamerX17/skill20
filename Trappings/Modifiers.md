# Equipment Materials and other Modifiers

## Quality Modifiers

Quality modifiers add an amount of cost that is relative to the base cost of the equipment. They only provide benefits if the user possesses certain skill requirements.

## Equipment Reinforcement Modifiers

Reinforcement adds a flat cost to the item, after all other modifiers are applied. In many cases, it may be cheaper to reinforce an old piece of equipment rather than get a new one crafted from superior materials. Reinforcement can be either magical or psionic - a distinction that initially matters little, but becomes more important as you face increasingly deadly foes of various sorts.

Weapons gain a bonus of +1 to accuracy and damage for each point of reinforcement. Ammunition is reinforced in batches of 50.

Armor gains 1 AC for each point of reinforcement. Shields gain 1 AC for every 2 points of reinforcement. Rings, amulets, bracers, and other such items can be reinforced as if they were armor, causing them to become items "Of Protection" or "Of Armor".

- +1: +1,000 gold value
- +2: +4,000 gold value
- +3: +9,000 gold value
- +4: +16,000 gold value
- +5: +25,000 gold value
- +6: +36,000 gold value
- +7: +49,000 gold value
- +8: +64,000 gold value
- +9: +81,000 gold value
- +10: +100,000 gold value

### Crafting Equipment Reinforcements

The crafter's experience level must be at least triple the desired reinforcement level. The crafter must use up half of the gold cost in reinforcement materials. The skill check to craft is an extended check, with a difficulty of 100 x Reinforcement Level and a time scale of one roll per day.

## Weapon Infusion Modifiers

Weapon Infusions can only be applied to weapons, and other objects that can be used for attacking. If applied to a natural weapon, then the infusion only lasts 7 days.

Each infusion has a flat cost of 5,000 gold.

- Fire: The weapon damage's element is changed to fire.
- Blessed: The weapon damage's element is changed to true sunlight. The weapon now always uses Wisdom for accuracy and damage.
- Blood: On an attack accuracy roll of a natural 19 or 20, the target starts bleeding. This only applies to targets that are capable of bleeding.
- Crystal: The weapon damage's element is changed to magic. The weapon now always uses Intelligence for accuracy and damage.
