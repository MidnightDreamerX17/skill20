# Traits

## Advantages

**Ascetic Training** - The character gives up all ten starting skills in order to have one advanced skill of choice. This advantage is incompatible with all other advantages and disadvantages that change a character's starting skills.

**Enhanced Attribute** - One of the character's attributes is increased by 2.

**Favored Enemy Category** - The character gains a bonus of +2 for everything relating to that enemy category, including Armor Class.

**Magic Domain** - The character is strongly aligned with a specific domain of magic, causing the domain spells to be considered a lower magic circle. For example, being specialized in the Healing Domain will cause *Cure Light Wounds* to be considered a spell of the 0th circle. If a spell was already 0th-circle, then its casting time becomes a move action.

**Magic School** - The character is strongly aligned with one specific school of magic, causing that school's spells to be considered a lower magic circle. For example, being specialized in the Evocation Magic School will cause *Magic Missile* to be considered a spell of the 0th circle. If a spell was already 0th-circle, then its casting time becomes a move action. "Universal" is not a valid school for this trait.

**Natural Armor 2** - The character's Armor Class is improved by 2. This trait cannot be taken if the character's race already provides Natural Armor.

**Natural Insulation 5** - The character gains a bonus of +5 to endure harsh weather conditions. This trait cannot be taken if the character's race already provides Natural Insulation.

**Patron God** - The character is strongly aligned with one specific deity, or one pantheon of deities. This grants a combination of constant benefits and exclusive access to certain spells, but also tends to involve a strict code of conduct. The character can always expect a heightened amount of hospitality at temples of the patron deity.

**Patron Guild** - The character gains two ranks in one guild. This trait can be taken multiple times for the same guild, for different guilds, and for guilds that the character has gained ranks for from other traits.

**Powerful Family** - The character has a powerful family with many servants and a fortified home. The family home is big and secure enough to accommodate the whole party. The character can attempt to beg for money from their family as well, although that is better covered by the Wealthy Family trait.

**Psionic Category** - The character is strongly aligned with a specific category of psionics, causing that category's powers to be considered a lower power circle, and its power point cost to be reduced by 1.  For example, being specialized in the Warrior category will cause *Body Adjustment* to become a 3rd-circle power. If a power was already 0th-circle, then its manifestation time becomes a move action. Power point costs cannot go below 1. The "Power" category cannot be taken with this trait.

**Psionic Discipline** - The character is strongly aligned with a specific discipline of psionics, causing that discipline's powers to be considered a lower power circle, and its power point cost to be reduced by 1. For example, being specialized in the Clairsentience discipline will cause *Aura Sight* to become a 3rd-circle power. If a power was already 0th-circle, then its manifestation time becomes a move action. Power point costs cannot go below 1.

**Reincarnate** - The character is a reincarnation. As the character gains experience levels, they regain memories of people, places, and events from their past lives. Spending experience points on skills could be role-played as the character remembering old instincts. If the GM requires training time for skill improvement, then the character can use that time to revisit places that their past lives have used those skills at.

**Skilled** - The character starts with 1 additional skill. It cannot be an Advanced skill. For starting with additional Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession skills, the advantage of Work Experience is more efficient.

**Streetwise** - The character's mandatory Craft skill is changed to Locks (DEX), mandatory Knowledge skill is changed to Traps (INT), mandatory Perform skill is changed to Persuasion (CHA), and mandatory Profession skill is changed to Stealth (DEX).

**Wealthy Family** - The character's starting wealth is changed to 300 gold from their own family, with no debt to Adventure Capital.

**Weapon Category Specialization** - The character has been training their whole life with one category of weapons. They get a bonus of +1 for everything relating to that category of weapons, including Armor Class when attacked by that type of weapon. Guaranteed hits occur on both 19 and 20. The categories of weapon specialization are as follows:

- Axes, Picks, & Scythes
- Chains, Whips, & Flails
- Hammers, Maces, & Clubs
- Polearms, Pikes, & Lances
- Short Weapons (includes knives, daggers, batons, tonfas, rolled-up newspapers, books, etc.)
- Spears, Rods, & Staves
- Swords, Slashing
- Swords, Straight, One-Handed
- Swords, Straight, Two-Handed
- Unarmed & Natural Weapons
- Archery
- Point-and-Shoot Weapons (includes blowguns, crossbows, firearms, etc.)
- Throwing Weapons & Slings

**Work Experience** - The character starts with five additional skills, but only in the categories of Craft, Knowledge, Perform, and Profession.

## Disadvantages

**Arachnophobia** - The character is afraid of spiders and has a penalty of -2 to all checks relating to them.

**Bad Credit Rating** - The character's starting wealth is changed to only 70 gold loaned from Adventure Capital, with 40 gold already spent on an adventuring kit. The amount that must be repaid to Adventure Capital is 70 gold (i.e. zero interest), but the consequences for failure to repay are more severe (i.e. repossession of family property, family members taken as indentured servants, bodily harm to the character, and the like). Furthermore, the character will be unable to get financing of any kind, except from loan sharks and other illegal channels. Clearing up the credit rating will take a lot more than just showing off how much wealth the character has gotten through adventuring. It will require all sorts of paperwork, difficult interactions with banks, etc.

**Enemy God** - The enemy god will give a bonus of +2 to its servants, for all d20 rolls against the character.

**Moon Madness** - During the three nights of the full moon, the character is unable to sleep while the full moon is out in the night sky.

Or, if opposed to an Association, then the character must have a Quirk that makes them of the same alignment as that Association.

**Opposed Magic Domain** - Spells from this domain are considered to be of a higher spell circle. For example, being opposed to the Healing domain will result in *Cure Light Wounds* being a spell of the 2nd circle. A character must start with the ability to memorize and cast 1st-circle spells in order to have an Opposed Magic Domain.

**Opposed Magic School** - Spells from this school are considered to be of a higher spell circle. For example, being opposed to the Evocation school will result in *Magic Missile* being a spell of the 2nd circle. A character must start with the ability to memorize and cast 1st-circle spells in order to have an Opposed Magic School.

**Opposed Psionic Category** - Powers from this category are considered to be of a higher power circle. For example, being opposed to the Warrior category will cause *Body Adjustment* to become a 5th-circle power.

**Sexist** - The character has a penalty of -10 to all interactions with the specified sex. If the sex is "neutral", "plural", or "other" then the character must be of a race for which this is common, e.g. a Law-Mech being sexist against neuters.

**Slow Starter** - The character only rolls 1d10 for initiative, rather than 1d100 + Dexterity score.

**Terminal Disorder** - The character's Constitution decreases by 1 at every Experience Level. This can only be removed by *Greater Restoration* or greater magical power.

**Unskilled** - The character only starts with four skills of choice, rather than six. Note that this makes it hard for the character to gain Experience Levels until they can get training from guilds for two new skills.

**Unusual Body Shape** - The base price of armor, before other modifiers, is doubled. This trait cannot be taken if the character's race already causes Unusual Body Shape.

The character must roll to defeat their own Spell Resistance in order to cast spells.

**Beastial Spirit (Specific)** - Spells and powers relating to this spirit are considered to be one circle lower. For example, having a Beastial Spirit of Bear will allow the character to use *Summon Nature's Ally I* as if it were *Summon Nature's Ally II* in order to summon a bear. On the other hand, the character's personality is strongly modified depending on the spirit, having a penalty of -10 to all actions that are contrary to the spirit's nature.

**Darksign** - The character is undead, harmed by most effects that heal mortals. The character does not regain hit points by resting, instead needing to sit near magically-blessed fires. If killed, the character will come back to life the next day with 1 less maximum hit point and looking more dead. Once the character's maximum hit points go to zero, they will be raised as a mindless hollow. The cure to the darksign is only known by a select few, and by specific gods.

**Dependent** - The character has a non-adventurer dependent. If this person is killed, then the character must cease adventuring immediately for the rest of their lives and all future incarnations. The dependent's experience level is capped at 1/5th of the character's own.

**Documented Identity** - The character has a large number of records about them in multiple places, identifying their appearance, place of residence, family, and other such things. This could be used for the character's benefit, proving that they are an upstanding citizen, proving that they possess a noble title, etc. But, this information is also readily available to those who wish to do harm to the character.
