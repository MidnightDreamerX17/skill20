# Skill20 RPG

Goals:

- Map-less.
- Class-less, while still allowing players to quickstart as easy-to-play characters who fit the D&D classes if they choose to.
- As compatible as possible with D&D-family material (as long as it doesn't rely too much on exact maps).

Key Points for D&D veterans:

- Class-less - but it is easy to put together a skill set that contains everything you liked about the classic classes. In particular, fighters and wizards can now branch out a lot more easily. The need for a pure Thief is reduced if each character takes one or two skills typically associated with Thieves.
- Map-less rules provided in the core ruleset. This ruleset is designed to maintain a fast pace, to reduce prep time, and to avoid getting bogged down in minutiae during combat. All spells and psionics are also changed to make sense in map-less gameplay. If you want to continue using maps, it is easy to do so, and the rest of the system will not be broken.
- Characters can learn new skills from guilds. No need for prestige classes - having a wide set of skills requires your character to be prestigious in role-playing terms instead. If there are special abilities that come only from prestige classes, then they can easily be rewritten to come from new skills that are exclusive to certain guilds.
- Magic and psionics always take a full round to cast, making it more possible for spellcasters to get interrupted. The rules for interrupting spellcasting are also changed - damage must be dealt to the spellcaster in order to force a concentration check.
- No attacks of opportunity, because they make no sense.
- Grappling rules that make sense, rather than just assuming that all acts of grappling are bear-hugging.
- Characters don't start with gold - instead, they start with a loan from Adventure Capital.

Significant balance differences compared to D&D:

- The increased flexibility in character creation means that parties should be much more well-rounded. A party of four should have all bases covered. "Fighters" can do more than just fight. "Wizards" should be able to fall back on some other skill when they run out of spells for the day.
- Maplessness has a significant effect on combat balance. Much experimentation is needed to see how a D&D encounter translates to a Skill20 encounter. Modules that are heavily map-dependent will need their special qualities represented in some other manner.
- It takes much longer for characters to be able to wear Full Plate Armor without penalty. Furthermore, there is only one hit die type. Consequently, frontline characters need to rely much more on healing, magic, setting up ambushes, etc. at the early levels.

This game uses d20 OGL content in order to get going as quickly as possible. Experienced GMs should make house rules to make the game work the way they want, since everyone must inevitably develop their own opinions on fantasy gaming.

Attacks of Opportunity do not exist. In fact, if your goal is to retreat, then it is realistically-safer to drop weapons and shields, turn around, and run as fast as you can. This method of retreat can only be punished by cavalry. Combatants may hold their attacks, then use them against enemies who come into range, but it is unrealistic for anyone to just suddenly turn around and hit someone to the side when they are already engaged in combat.
