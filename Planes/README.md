# The Planes

A visual representation of the relationships between the planes is available as an [SVG file](/Planes/Planar_Diagram.svg).

Each plane of existence is infinite in some way, i.e. it is impossible for a native creature to truly run out of resources. Although, advanced technology may be required to reach said resources in the case of the Prime Material.

The planes are divided into the following groups:

1. Alignment Planes
2. Astral Plane
3. Prime Material Planes
4. Ethereal Plane
5. Elemental Planes

## Quick Summary of the Planes

### Alignment Planes

All alignment planes are in the same "horizontal" layer.

The True Neutral Plane is finite on the outside, in that it has a maximum possible radius. But it is infinite on the inside, due to the way that travel time works.

### Astral Plane

The Astral Plane can be thought of as a bunch of thought-bubbles that could theoretically be in any position. Cities full of people, the remains of dead gods, astral fortresses, and other powerful collections of thought will have bigger "bubbles". Individuals have tiny bubbles. A bubble can be directed to intersect with another bubble based on various factors, such as how well they know each other, how many objects someone possesses from the other bubble, the sizes of their bubbles, etc. Larger bubbles are easier to find and enter in this manner. Once bubbles intersect, the people within them can start to see each other, and interact with each other in a way that slightly resembles real space.

In theory, the Astral Plane could be used as a quick way to travel between points of the Alignment and Prime Material Planes. Especially if you want to travel the alternate universes and timelines of the Prime Material, or jump from one alignment plane to another. In practice, you need to either find the set of astral pathways that suit your needs, or learn how to survive and travel through the Astral Plane, to take advantage of this possibility.

### Prime Material Planes

Each Prime Material Plane is a different universe, or a different timeline of a universe. They are all in the same "horizontal" layer.

### Ethereal Plane

The Ethereal Plane contains foggy versions of the Prime Material, but the distances between these foggy-copies have no relation whatsoever to Prime Material distances.

The Ethereal Plane also contains demiplanes, which represent specific concepts such as time, dread, fear, and the like. The Ethereal Plane and all contained demiplanes are in the same "horizontal" layer.

In theory, the Ethereal Plane could be used as a quick way to travel between points of the Prime Material and Elemental Planes. Especially if you want to travel the alternate universes and timelines of the Prime Material, or jump from one elemental plane to another. In practice, you need to either find the set of elemental conduits that suit your needs, or learn how to survive and travel through the Ethereal Plane, to take advantage of this possibility.

### Elemental Planes

All elemental planes are in the same "horizontal" layer.

## Summoning Across the Planes

Summoning magic cannot reach beyond the Prime Material Planes. This means that:

- While on the Astral or Alignment Planes - elementals can only be summoned from the Astral, Alignment, or Prime Material planes. Which is not nearly as many as live on the Elemental planes.
- While on the Ethereal or Elemental Planes - aligned creatures such as angels and demons can only be summoned from the Prime Material, Ethereal, or Elemental planes. Which is not nearly as many as live on the Alignment planes.
- While on the Prime Material Planes - summoning magic can pull from anywhere. However, trying to summon from a Prime Material universe that is too different, or has had too many timeline changes, will route through the Astral Plane before aiming back at the Prime.

## Magic Items Across The Planes

Magic items derive their energy from the planes they are created in. They lose one caster level, or their bonuses decrease by 1, for every planar step they are away from their origin. They cannot use portals, conduits, gates, etc. to trace their path to their origin.

**Example 1:** A magical longsword +2 is created on a Prime Material Plane. In the Astral Plane, it functions only as +1. In an alignment plane, it functions only as "magical". While on an alignment plane, there may be a portal to the Prime Material. If someone holds the longsword up to the portal, the longsword will still only function as "magical" with no bonus. Only by passing the longsword through the portal will it function as magical +2 again.

**Example 2:** A magical longsword +2 is created on a Prime Material Plane. In an alternate timeline with only one big change, the longsword functions as +1. In a completely different universe, or a timeline with two or more big changes, the longsword functions only as "magical" with no bonus. This is because the longsword's magical power has to route to the Astral Plane before reaching back towards the Prime.
